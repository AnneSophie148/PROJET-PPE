   The word “nostalgia” evokes images of everything from classic cars to
   Woodstock to bellbottoms, all the way back to the golden age of
   Hollywood. Think James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause, not James Van Der
   Beek in Dawson’s Creek. But the ’90s began 30 years ago, meaning that
   nostalgia for that decade today is akin to nostalgia for the 1970s in
   the year 2000. And no one made a fuss about that.

   it’s the millennial generation’s turn.

   The ’90s nostalgia kick began in the early 2010s but gained serious
   traction in recent years, fuelled by total pop culture recall like the
   resurgence of the hit sitcom Friends — thanks to Netflix — including

   followers in just over five hours. She currently stands at 21 million
   followers and counting.

   Of course, millennials make up close to 65 per cent of Instagram’s user
   base, which explains why ‘90s nostalgia accounts flourish, offering
   users a regular fix of the decade’s cultural headliners, from the
   Britney Spears/Justin Timberlake romance to Kirk Cobain candids to

The 1990s as Nostalgia? As If!

   Instagram, following it up with a podcast about nostalgia and now
   a website, Capsule 98.  It’s dedicated to “the formative objects,
   places and experiences that shape who we are,” regardless of generation
   or decade.

   The 34-year-old suggests one reason for the boom in ’90s nostalgia is
   that millennials fully indulge it online in a way that previous
   generations, who didn’t have the internet when they were in their 20s

   Bergman may be on to something. In 2013, University of Surrey
   psychologist Erica Hepper told the New York Times that feelings of
   nostalgia actually peak in young adults and again in old age while
   slumping somewhat in the years in between.  “Nostalgia helps us deal
   with transitions,” Hepper said. “The young adults are just moving away
   from home and or starting their first jobs, so they fall back on
   memories of family Christmases, pets and friends in school.”

   For millennials, like other generations, nostalgia serves as a safety
   blanket, a source of comfort and a means of temporary escape from the
   demands of adulthood. The word “nostalgia” itself is a combination of
   two Greek words that mean “homecoming” and “pain.” Or, in other words,
   homesick.

   But Bergman adds that nostalgia also serves another purpose, serving as
   a kind of online shorthand.

   Another Canadian millennial, Lee Davis, 24, takes the idea of nostalgia
   as communication to the next level with HideSeek, a pop-up he
   co-founded that currently resides in Montreal and courts millennials

   HideSeek is unique in the nostalgia business in that it isn’t pegged to
   specific pop-culture references. Guests tour rooms outfitted with
   elements relatable to all generations: rooms themed around items like

   “That’s what we really focused on — less about specific nostalgic
   memories and more to create an experience that lets you feel like a
   kid,” Davis says. His idea of nostalgia is centred on the notion of
   “play,” evoking memories of recess or after school sports.

   “Nostalgia’s just so powerful,” he adds. “And I can just see it from
   the customers’ reactions. When they see something that reminds them of
   their past or it makes them feel like kids, they get this warm, gushy

   routine?’”

Beyond ’90s Nostalgia

   At the same time, millennial nostalgia extends beyond the 1990s to
   feeling  fondness for a time they didn’t even experience.

   For Wren, “Nostalgia kicks in when you’re trying to keep a feeling
   alive, keep a memory alive. I think nostalgia’s more of a feeling. It’s
   sometimes not even [attached to] a time frame.” And like nostalgic
   millennials, Wren says that many of the older audience members she

   In reality, both baby boomers and millennials yearn for a simpler time.
   The only difference is the decade for which they long. Generational
   preferences aside, though, it turns out that nostalgia is actually good
   for you.

   Clay Routledge, a psychology professor and author of Nostalgia: A
   Psychological Resource, told New Orleans Public Radio in 2017 that
   while people turn to nostalgia in times of stress,  it actually makes
   them more optimistic about the future. He adds that studies “show this
   both in terms of people reporting that they’re more optimistic about
   the future, more inspired but also behaviourally, too, in terms of
   people actually going out and wanting to interact with and meet people
   after they’ve engaged in nostalgia.”

   So ultimately, while decades and generations move on, the human impulse
   to revisit our past for a nostalgic boost remains constant. And that’s
   a good thing, regardless of what you actually consider nostalgia.

   “I feel like everybody connects to nostalgia in a different way,
   whether you’re 90 or you’re 10,” Bergman says. “I think about it all
   the time — what are the things now that we take for granted or that are
