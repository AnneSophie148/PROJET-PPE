When Nostalgia Tilts to Sad: Anticipatory and Personal Nostalgia

     * Le Moyne College, Syracuse, NY, United States

   Contemporary research has showcased many benefits of nostalgia, but its
   bittersweet character and historical reputation as unhealthy raise the
   possibility of less favorable impacts. In recent studies, daily diary
   data highlighted nostalgia’s mixed valence and suggested that nostalgia
   is more strongly associated with negative feelings. Variables that
   influence the adaptive or maladaptive dimensions of nostalgia have not
   yet been fully explored. Recently, a focus on when nostalgia is
   experienced relative to past and future was introduced in the construct
   of anticipatory nostalgia, missing the present prematurely before it
   has become past. Distinct from personal nostalgia, anticipatory
   nostalgia was found to be characterized by difficulty enjoying the
   present and a tendency toward sadness and worry. The present study
   examines the distinctive dynamics at play in anticipatory and personal
   nostalgia by exploring the relationship between each type of
   dispositional nostalgia and reported experience with happy and sad
   stories. The Nostalgia Inventory, the Survey of Anticipatory Nostalgia,
   and a brief form of the PANAS were completed by 144 undergraduates (110
   women), who rated their exposure and reactions to happy and sad
   stories. Reported frequency of exposure to happy and sad stories was
   related to dispositional happiness and sadness. Personal and
   anticipatory nostalgia did not differ in frequency of exposure to happy
   and sad stories, but they did differ in reactivity to and learning from
   sad stories. Findings highlight the importance of the timing of
   nostalgia, consistent with the distinction between nostalgia for the
   past and nostalgia for what is still present.

Introduction

   In contrast to nostalgia’s dark origins in medical history as a disease
   construct, contemporary researchers have largely rediscovered nostalgia
   as a healthy psychological phenomenon. Empirical evidence has
   contradicted historical arguments that nostalgia reflects an inability
   to accept the loss of the past or serves as an obstacle to living in
   the present or moving forward (Werman, 1977; Kaplan, 1984, 1987).
--

   However, recent research has revived questions about possible
   unfavorable aspects of nostalgia by highlighting its distinctive
   bittersweet nature (Larsen et al., 2001; Larsen and McGraw, 2011, 2014;
   Hepper et al., 2012). While most studies have found that nostalgia
   increases positive affect, instances of elevated negative affect,
   including sadness, have been identified (Zinchenko, 2011; Stephan et
   al., 2012; Newman et al., 2019). The extent to which nostalgia is
   uplifting and helpful or bitter and counterproductive might depend upon
   personality traits or contextual variables (Barrett et al., 2010;
   Köneke, 2010; Wildschut et al., 2010, 2019; Hart et al., 2011; Iyer and
   Jetten, 2011; Seehusen et al., 2013; Abeyta et al., 2014; Garrido,
   2018). One largely unexplored variable is the timing of nostalgia
   (Batcho, 2020). As an experience that unfolds over time, nostalgia’s
   impact might depend upon the cognitive appraisal that directs the
   feelings and thoughts generated during a nostalgic episode.

   When nostalgia focuses on loss that has not yet occurred, the sadness
   of anticipated loss is premature and the experience becomes a
   paradoxical phenomenon of enjoying the present while missing it as if
   already relegated to the past. Dubbed anticipatory nostalgia, such
   premature nostalgia has been introduced as a construct in its own right
   (Batcho and Shikh, 2016; Bergs et al., 2019). A form of nostalgia by
   definition, it can be distinguished from personal nostalgia. Personal
   nostalgia is missing what has been lost, whereas anticipatory nostalgia
   involves missing what has not yet been lost. Anticipatory nostalgia
   depends upon mentally creating an imagined future that gives rise to
   missing what will be “someday past,” yet still present. By engaging
   abstract construal, anticipatory nostalgia might engender psychological
   distance from the present, decreasing direct involvement in the current
   concrete reality (Nussbaum et al., 2003).

   Anticipatory nostalgia should not be confused with anticipated
   nostalgia. Anticipated nostalgia is the prediction or expectation that
   one will feel nostalgic for an aspect of the present in the future, not
   feeling nostalgic in the present. Predicting future nostalgia is an
   interesting cognitive process but not identical to the emotional
   phenomenon of feeling nostalgic before the future loss occurs. A person
   can expect to miss a loved one when they leave or die someday, but the
   expectation doesn’t necessarily include the emotional component of
   nostalgic missing. Expecting future nostalgia has been shown to predict
   nostalgia after an important life transition. The finding of a greater
   likelihood of expecting future nostalgia for more positive experiences
   is not surprising, as people would be likely to expect to miss
   enjoyable or valued events. Expecting future nostalgia was associated
   with greater savoring of the experience, and post-transition nostalgia
   was associated with benefits, including enhanced self-esteem, social
   connectedness, and meaning in life (Cheung et al., 2019).

   By contrast, it is not clear whether anticipatory nostalgia, premature
   missing of what is still present, shares the benefits of nostalgia for
   the past. Despite eliciting the sadness of loss, anticipatory nostalgia
   might also allow reappraisal of the present. In spite of or because of
   the sadness, anticipating loss during adversity might encourage
--
   present and providing the comfort of knowing that difficulties will not
   last. Initial empirical investigations to identify the benefits or
   disadvantages of anticipatory nostalgia assessed anticipatory nostalgia
   as a dispositional trait, that is, as the tendency of individuals to
   experience it generally. The early studies supported the viability of
   anticipatory nostalgia as a construct distinguishable from personal
   nostalgia (Batcho and Shikh, 2016). Unlike dispositional personal
   nostalgia, dispositional anticipatory nostalgia was characterized by a
   greater tendency for people and experiences to cause worry and sadness
   and was more likely to occur in adverse circumstances.

   The present study extends the early research by exploring the
   relationship between nostalgia and experience with stories. A
   substantial amount of the existing research on nostalgia has examined
   memories. Like memories, stories entail the past inherently by
   recounting what has happened in the past. Stories differ from memories
--
   (Pratt and Fiese, 2004; Kiser et al., 2010). In their memoirs, members
   of the resistance during World War II explained how stories encountered
   during childhood generated nostalgia and played pivotal roles in their
   dedication to the resistance, even to the point of enduring hardships
   and risking death (Batcho, 2018).
--
   The present work introduced a focus on accumulated exposure to stories
   over time. In an investigation of the relationship between overall
   exposure to stories and personal and anticipatory nostalgia,
   participants estimated and shared their experience with happy and sad
   stories. If experiencing nostalgia prematurely is less adaptive than
   missing what is already past, anticipatory nostalgia will be aligned
   with unfavorable reactions to stories, whereas personal nostalgia will
   be associated with positive reactions. In particular, exposure to happy
   and sad stories was examined to explore whether dispositional
   anticipatory nostalgia is associated with greater exposure, reactivity,
   or attraction to sad stories. If the association of anticipatory
   nostalgia with sadness reflects an overall sad disposition,
   anticipatory nostalgia would be expected to correlate with greater
   exposure to or recall of sad stories. If anticipatory nostalgia
   develops in response to sad experiences, reported exposure to sad
   stories would be expected to correlate with anticipatory nostalgia.
   However, prior research has not examined the possibility of cognitive
   benefits. If anticipating future loss entails helpful cognitive
   processing, anticipatory nostalgia will be associated with greater
   likelihood of learning from sad stories.

   the college Institutional Review Board for compliance with ethical
   guidelines. In small groups in a laboratory room, participants
   completed paper forms of the Nostalgia Inventory, the Survey of
   Anticipatory Nostalgia, selected items from Watson and Clark’s (1994)
   Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Expanded Form (PANAS-X), and a
   survey of experience with happy and sad stories constructed for this
   study.

   The Nostalgia Inventory assessed personal nostalgia as a dispositional
   trait (Batcho, 1995, 1998, 2007). Consistent with Stern’s (1992)
   definition of nostalgia as the longing for one’s past, respondents rate
   the extent to which they miss each of 20 items from when they were
   younger on a 9-point scale (1 = Not at all, 9 = Very much). The

   (Batcho et al., 2008), and test-retest reliability of 0.82 over a
   4-week interval (Batcho et al., 2011). Consistent with prior research,
   the Nostalgia Inventory yielded an acceptable level of internal
   consistency of 0.88 as measured by Cronbach’s alpha and a split-half
   reliability of 0.81 in this study.

   The Survey of Anticipatory Nostalgia focuses on future loss rather than
   the past (e.g., “society will change”). Given a 9-point scale (1 =
   rarely/not very, 9 = very often/very much), respondents were

   As in prior research (Batcho and Shikh, 2016), mean ratings on the
   Nostalgia Inventory correlated moderately with mean ratings on the
   Survey of Anticipatory Nostalgia, r[(][142][)] = 0.52, p < 0.001.

   The Survey of Experience with Stories (Appendix) included eight items

Gender

   Men and women did not differ in average personal nostalgia scores, t(1,
   142) = −1.768, p = 0.084, η[p]^2 = 0.029, but women (M = 6.00, SD =
   1.18) scored higher in anticipatory nostalgia than did men (M = 5.24,
   SD = 1.20), t(1, 142) = −3.29, p = 0.001, η[p]^2 = 0.071.

Nostalgia and Positive and Negative Affect

   Ratings of PANAS-X items of generalized affect yielded additional
   evidence for anticipatory nostalgia as a distinct construct. Ratings
   from the three items cheerful, happy, and joyful were averaged to yield
   a composite measure of a tendency toward happiness. Ratings from the
   three items sad, blue, and downhearted were averaged to serve as a
   measure of sadness. Personal nostalgia was not correlated with
   happiness, r[(][142][)] = 0.06, p = 0.476, or sadness, r[(][142][)] =
   0.12, p = 0.136, whereas anticipatory nostalgia correlated
   significantly with sadness, r[(][142][)] = 0.21, p = 0.012, but not
   with happiness, r[(][142][)] = 0.14, p = 0.087.

Nostalgia and Experience With Happy and Sad Stories

   The relationship of personal and anticipatory nostalgia to exposure and
   reactions to happy and sad stories was explored in correlational
   analyses, with gender and dispositional sadness and happiness
--
   number of stories recalled were not correlated for happy stories,
   r[(][142][)] = 0.01, p = 0.922, or sad stories, r[(][142][)] = 0.11, p
   = 0.197, and served as independent measures. Neither type of nostalgia
   correlated significantly with either indicator of frequency of exposure
   to happy and sad stories, suggesting that people prone to personal or
   anticipatory nostalgia have not experienced happy and sad stories more
   or less often. Attraction to or preference for sad or happy stories was
   assessed by asking participants to rate how often they choose happy and
   sad stories. Neither type of nostalgia correlated significantly with
   story choice, suggesting that proneness to personal or anticipatory
   nostalgia does not reflect an underlying bias or preference for happy
   or sad material.

   However, ratings suggested that they react differently to happy and sad
   stories emotionally and cognitively. Emotionally, personal and
   anticipatory nostalgia both correlated with sadness induced by sad
   stories, but only personal nostalgia correlated significantly with
   happiness elicited by happy stories. Results suggested that personal
   and anticipatory nostalgia differed in cognitive engagement with
   stories. Personal nostalgia correlated with learning from happy
   stories, whereas anticipatory nostalgia correlated with learning from
   sad stories. Consistent with prior findings of an association between
   anticipatory nostalgia and a tendency to be made sad by people and
   events, these results suggested that people prone to anticipatory
   nostalgia may be less reactive to happy stories. Present findings
   suggested that people prone to anticipatory nostalgia process sad
   stories in more productive ways, whereas people prone to personal
   nostalgia are more reactive to happy stories and process happy stories
   in beneficial ways.

Contributions of Nostalgia and Stories to Mood

   The contributions of nostalgia and stories to dispositional mood were
   explored further in linear regression analyses (Table 2). The composite
   happiness ratings were examined in a linear regression analysis, with
   gender and mean ratings from the Nostalgia Inventory and the Survey of
   Anticipatory Nostalgia independent variables. The role of stories was
   explored with the inclusion of mean ratings of frequency of exposure to
   happy and sad stories, degree of happiness (sadness) induced by happy

   exposure to happy, but not sad stories. Similarly, happiness was

   A parallel analysis was conducted with the composite sadness ratings as
   the dependent variable. In a significant model, F(9, 133) = 1.92, p =
   0.05, Adjusted R^2 = 0.055, gender, personal nostalgia, and
   anticipatory nostalgia were not significant. Dispositional sadness was
   predicted by the frequency of exposure to sad, but not happy stories.
   However, sadness was not predicted by the sadness elicited by sad
--
   This study introduced a focus on stories as a vehicle for comparing
   emotional and cognitive reactions to cumulative meaningful experiences
   associated with personal and anticipatory nostalgia. Not allowing
   causal relationships to be determined, this exploratory study
   encourages future research based on experimental designs to identify
   variables responsible for the differences between personal and
   anticipatory nostalgia. Further research is needed also to explore
   participant variables in samples characterized by broader demographic
   and diversity constituents.

   A fuller understanding of adaptive functions of nostalgia would be
   advanced with studies that identify the nature and content of the
   stories participants prone to personal or anticipatory nostalgia were
   exposed to and remember. Similarly, future work is needed to determine
   how those prone to nostalgia learn or benefit from happy or sad
   stories. Qualitative analyses of the impactful stories can yield
   insights into the nature of the lessons acquired.

Discussion

   The present findings reinforced the importance of when nostalgia is
   felt relative to past and future. Results are consistent with the view
   of anticipatory nostalgia as distinguishable from personal nostalgia
   and worthy of further research as a distinct phenomenon. Stories were
   shown to be effective material for elucidating the roles of emotional
   and cognitive processes in personal and anticipatory nostalgia.
   Exploring reactions to stories can clarify the adaptive and maladaptive
   functions of nostalgia within a meaningful practical context. Access to
   24 h news cycles and online venues have expanded the influence of the
   content and format of stories. The current findings highlight the
--
   the listener or viewer.

   Pertinent to the current study, personal and anticipatory nostalgia
   were distinguished by different ways of interacting with stories. There
   was no evidence that differential exposure to happy and sad stories
   accounted for the distinction. Personal and anticipatory nostalgia both
   correlated with being made sad by sad stories, suggesting that
   participants prone to anticipatory nostalgia are not more sensitive to
   sad stories. However, only personal nostalgia was associated with being
   made happy by happy stories, suggesting that anticipatory nostalgia may
   be associated with less reactivity to happy stories. Furthermore,
   personal nostalgia was related to greater likelihood of learning from
   happy stories, whereas anticipatory nostalgia was associated with
   greater likelihood of learning from sad stories.

   Prior research differentiated personal and anticipatory nostalgia by
   their relationships to happiness and sadness. Personal and anticipatory
   nostalgia both include missing, longing or yearning. In personal
   nostalgia, we enjoy valued aspects of our past again, thereby enjoying
   them twice. In anticipatory nostalgia, we have only the present to
   enjoy them. In fact, we feel the sadness of missing them twice, once in
   the actual present and once in the imagined future. Envisioning what
   the future might bring can be accompanied by sadness missing the
   present and worry about what will come next. In prior research,
   participants prone to anticipatory nostalgia had reported a greater
   tendency for people and experiences to cause them worry and sadness,
   but anticipatory nostalgia did not predict generalized sadness.
   Consistent with prior research, anticipatory nostalgia did not
   contribute to generalized sadness in this study, suggesting that people
   prone to anticipatory nostalgia are not generally unhappy.

   Given that personal and anticipatory nostalgia are both emotional
   constructs, theorists are justified in comparing their emotional
   facets. The present findings highlight the wisdom of considering also
   the cognitive dynamics in the relationship of nostalgia to the impact
   of stories. Rather than generally unhappy, people prone to anticipatory
   nostalgia may be more likely to benefit from sad stories by learning
   ways of coping with current or future problems and anxiety. Their
   inclination to imagine the future as present may reflect conceptual
--
   lives. It remains for future investigations to identify the variables
   or conditions underlying the emotional and cognitive dynamics that
   distinguish personal from anticipatory nostalgia.

   The present findings encourage further research to determine the
   long-term effects of being immersed in happy or sad stories. The
   relationship of learning from sad stories with anticipatory nostalgia
   suggests that benefiting from stories may be facilitated by an ability
   to imagine how the survival or resolution of sadness in a story might
--
   consolation. But looking ahead brings the sad realization that the good
   of the present might be gone too. Future research is needed to
   determine if anticipatory nostalgia can be constructive in certain
   circumstances or applied therapeutically to remind people that time and
   the opportunity to be engaged in the present is fleeting. Sad stories
   may provide opportunities to deal with adversity safely from a
   distance, as anticipatory nostalgia allows loss to be confronted from a
   temporal distance.

--
   cognitive-emotional resources to buffer adverse outcomes. While sadness
   might be considered a maladaptive affective dimension of anticipatory
   nostalgia, the benefits of learning from sad material may suggest there
   are untapped adaptive cognitive functions of anticipatory nostalgia.
