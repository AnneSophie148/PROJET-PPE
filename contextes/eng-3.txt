   The archives director for The Saturday Evening Post said that the
   magazine has been regarded with "a mixture of nostalgia and
   affection".^[1] Shown: a Norman Rockwell cover from August 1924.

   Nostalgia is a sentimentality for the past, typically for a period or
   place with happy personal associations.^[2] The word nostalgia is a
   learned formation of a Greek compound, consisting of νόστος (nóstos),
   meaning "homecoming", a Homeric word, and ἄλγος (álgos), meaning
--
   Romanticism.^[2]

   Nostalgia is associated with a longing for the past, its personalities,
   possibilities, and events, especially the "good ol' days" or a "warm
   childhood".^[5] There is a predisposition, caused by cognitive biases
--
   intolerably bleak."^[9]

   The scientific literature on nostalgia usually refers to nostalgia
   regarding one's personal life and has mainly studied the effects of
   nostalgia as induced during these studies. Emotion is a strong evoker
   of nostalgia due to the processing of these stimuli first passing
   through the amygdala, the emotional seat of the brain. These
   recollections of one's past are usually important events, people one
--
   such as music,^[10] movies, television shows,^[11] and video
   games,^[12] as well as natural phenomena such as weather and
   environment^[13] can also be strong triggers of nostalgia.

Functions[edit]

   Nostalgia's definition has changed greatly over time. Consistent with
   its Greek word roots meaning "homecoming" and "pain," nostalgia was for
   centuries considered a potentially debilitating and sometimes fatal
   medical condition expressing extreme homesickness.^[4] The modern view
   is that nostalgia is an independent, and even positive, emotion that
   many people experience often. Nostalgia has been found to have
   important psychological functions, such as to improve mood, increase
   social connectedness, enhance positive self-regard, and provide
--
   one function, and overall seem to benefit those who experience them.
   Such benefits may lead to a chronic disposition or personality trait of
   "nostalgia proneness."^[15]^[16] Nostalgia has also been associated
   with learning and memory consolidation.^[17]

Improve mood[edit]

   Although nostalgia is often triggered by negative feelings, it results
   in increasing one's mood and heightening positive emotions, which can
   stem from feelings of warmth or coping resulting from nostalgic
   reflections. One way to improve mood is to effectively cope with
   problems that hinder one's happiness. Batcho (2013) found that
   nostalgia proneness positively related to successful methods of coping
   throughout all stages—planning and implementing strategies, and
   reframing the issue positively. These studies led to the conclusion
   that the coping strategies that are likely among nostalgia-prone people
   often lead to benefits during stressful times. Nostalgia can be
   connected to more focus on coping strategies and implementing them,
   thus increasing support in challenging times.^[18]

   Nostalgia also sometimes involves memories of people one was close to,
   and thus it can increase one's sense of social support and connections.
   Nostalgia is also triggered specifically by feelings of loneliness, but
   counteracts such feelings with reflections of close relationships.
   According to Zhou et al. (2008), lonely people often have lesser
   perceptions of social support. Loneliness, however, leads to nostalgia,
   which actually increases perceptions of social support. Thus, Zhou and
   colleagues (2008) concluded that nostalgia serves a restorative
   function for individuals regarding their social connectedness.^[19]

   A desire for more social interaction is often the motivation for
   historical reenactments, which bring together people with a shared
   nostalgia for historical periods of past times. These events' hands-on,
   improvisational natures often facilitate socialization.^[20]

Enhance positive self-regard[edit]

   Nostalgia serves as a coping mechanism and helps people to feel better
   about themselves. Vess et al. (2012) found that the subjects who
   thought of nostalgic memories showed greater accessibility of positive
--
Provide existential meaning[edit]

   Nostalgia helps increase one's self-esteem and meaning in life by
   buffering threats to well-being and also by initiating a desire to deal
   with problems or stress. Routledge (2011) and colleagues found that
   nostalgia correlates positively with one's sense of meaning in life.
   The second study revealed that nostalgia increases one's perceived
   meaning in life, which was thought to be mediated by a sense of social
   support or connectedness. Thirdly, the researchers found that
   threatened meaning can even act as a trigger for nostalgia, thus
   increasing one's nostalgic reflections. By triggering nostalgia,
   though, one's defensiveness to such threat is minimized as found in the
   fourth study. The final two studies found that nostalgia is able to not
   only create meaning but buffer threats to meaning by breaking the
   connection between a lack of meaning and one's well-being. Follow-up
   studies also completed by Routledge in 2012 not only found meaning as a
   function of nostalgia, but also concluded that nostalgic people have
   greater perceived meaning, search for meaning less, and can better
   buffer existential threat.^[22]^[23]
--
Promote psychological growth[edit]

   Nostalgia makes people more willing to engage in growth-oriented
   behaviors and encourages them to view themselves as growth-oriented
   people. Baldwin & Landau (2014) found that nostalgia leads people to
   rate themselves higher on items like "I am the kind of person who
   embraces unfamiliar people, events, and places." Nostalgia also
   increased interest in growth-related behavior such as "I would like to
   explore someplace that I have never been before." In the first study,
   these effects were statistically mediated by nostalgia-induced positive
   affect—the extent to which nostalgia made participants feel good. In
   the second study, nostalgia led to the same growth outcomes but the
   effects were statistically mediated by nostalgia-induced
   self-esteem.^[24]

As a deception[edit]

   One recent study critiques the idea of nostalgia, which in some forms
   can become a defense mechanism by which people avoid the historical
   facts.^[25] This study looked at the different portrayals of apartheid
   in South Africa and argued that nostalgia appears as two ways,^[26]
   'restorative nostalgia' a wish to return to that past, and 'reflective
   nostalgia' which is more critically aware.

As a comfort[edit]
--
   suggests that by invoking the idea of an idealized past, politicians
   can provoke the social and cultural anxieties and uncertainties that
   make nostalgia especially attractive—and effective—as a tool of
   political persuasion.^[29]^[30]

--
Books[edit]

   A person can deliberately trigger feelings of nostalgia by listening to
   familiar music, looking at old photos, or visiting comforting
   environments of the past.^[31] With this knowledge widely available,
   many books have been published specifically to evoke the feeling of
   nostalgia. Books are just one of many media used in the monetization of
   nostalgia^[32]^[circular reference].

Music[edit]
--
   Hearing an old song can bring back memories for a person. A song heard
   once at a specific moment and then not heard again until a far later
   date will give the listener a sense of nostalgia for the date
   remembered and events that occurred then. However, if it is heard
   throughout life, it may lose its association with any specific period
--
Movies[edit]

   Old movies can trigger nostalgia. This is particularly true for
   generations who grew up as children during specific film eras such as
   the animation renaissance of the 1990s. Rewatching classic movies can
--
TV shows[edit]

   Old television shows can trigger nostalgia. People gravitate towards
   shows they watched as children, as the memories from one's youth are
   often the most significant of their lives.^[11]
--
Video games[edit]

   Old video games can trigger nostalgia. Retro gaming has become a
   recreational activity among older generations who played them as
   children.^[12]
--

   Nature-based factors such as weather and temperature can trigger
   nostalgia. Scientific studies have shown that cold weather makes people
   more nostalgic, while nostalgia causes people to feel warmer.^[13] In
   some societies, elements of nature often trigger a nostalgia for past
   times when nature played a larger role in culture.^[33] Environmental
   philosopher Glenn Albrecht coined the term 'solastalgia' in his 2003
--
   word is formed from the Latin sōlācium (comfort) and the Greek root
   ἄλγος (pain, suffering) to describe a form of emotional or existential
   distress caused by environmental destruction. Nostalgia differs from
   solastalgia because nostalgia is typically generated by spatial
   separation from important places or persons (one's home, one's family,
   or loved ones) with which it is often possible, in principle, to
--

   The term was coined in 1688 by Johannes Hofer (1669–1752) in his Basel
   dissertation. Hofer introduced nostalgia or mal du pays "homesickness"
   for the condition also known as mal du Suisse "Swiss illness", because
   of its frequent occurrence in Swiss mercenaries who in the plains of
--
   thought to include fainting, high fever, and death.

   English homesickness is a loan translation of nostalgia. Sir Joseph
   Banks used the word in his journal during the first voyage of Captain
   Cook. On 3 September 1770 he stated that the sailors "were now pretty
   far gone with the longing for home which the Physicians have gone so
   far as to esteem a disease under the name of Nostalgia", but his
   journal was not published in his lifetime.^[35] Cases resulting in
   death were known and soldiers were sometimes successfully treated by
--

   In the eighteenth century, scientists were looking for a locus of
   nostalgia, a nostalgic bone. By the 1850s nostalgia was losing its
   status as a particular disease and coming to be seen rather as a
   symptom or stage of a pathological process. It was considered as a form
   of melancholia and a predisposing condition among suicides. Nostalgia
   was, however, still diagnosed among soldiers as late as the American
   Civil War.^[36] By the 1870s interest in nostalgia as a medical
   category had almost completely vanished. Nostalgia was still being
   recognized in both the First and Second World Wars, especially by the
   American armed forces. Great lengths were taken to study and understand
--
   (see the BBC documentary Century of the Self).

   Nostalgia is triggered by something reminding an individual of an event
   or item from their past. The resulting emotion can vary from happiness
   to sorrow. The term "feeling nostalgic" is more commonly used to
--
Romanticism[edit]

   Swiss nostalgia was linked to the singing of Kuhreihen, which were
   forbidden to Swiss mercenaries because they led to nostalgia to the
   point of desertion, illness or death. The 1767 Dictionnaire de Musique
   by Jean-Jacques Rousseau claims that Swiss mercenaries were threatened
--
   Chalet by Adolphe Charles Adam (1834) which was performed for Queen
   Victoria under the title The Swiss Cottage. The Romantic connection of
   nostalgia, was a significant factor in the enthusiasm for Switzerland
   and the development of early Tourism in Switzerland that took hold of
   the European cultural elite in the 19th century. German Romanticism

In rhetoric and communication[edit]

   Nostalgia has been frequently studied as a tool of rhetoric and
   persuasion. Communication scholar Stephen Depoe,^[37] for example,
   writes that in nostalgic messaging: “a speaker highlights a comparison
   between a more favorable, idealized past and a less favorable present
   in order to stimulate [nostalgia]. . . . [linking] his/her own policies
   to qualities of the idealized past in order to induce support” (179).
   Rhetorician William Kurlinkus^[38]^[39] taxonomizes nostalgia on this
   foundation, arguing that nostalgic rhetoric generally contains three
   parts:
    1. A loss or threat in the present: the chaotic change that nostalgia
       responds to. Though some theorists^[40] argue that the ideal must
       truly be lost, other scholars including Kurlinkus argue that the
       ideal may simply be threatened to trigger nostalgia.
    2. A nostalgic crux: a person, group, corporation, et al. that is
       blamed for the loss of the nostalgic ideal. To perform such
--
       source of recovering the good memory. Such cruxes have include
       groups from polluting corporations to immigrants.
    3. Hope: Finally, Kurlinkus argues that though nostalgia is often
       performed ironically it almost always has a true hope for
       recovering the god memory (whether this means some kind of true
       restoration or a more symbolic recovery of an ethic). Such hope
       differentiates nostalgia from similar emotions like melancholia,
       which contains all of nostalgia's longing for lost ideals without a
       desire to move out of that past.

As an advertising tool[edit]

   In media and advertising, nostalgia-evoking images, sounds, and
   references can be used strategically to create a sense of connectedness
   between consumers and products with the goal of convincing the public
   to consume, watch, or buy advertised products.^[41] Modern technology
   facilitates nostalgia-eliciting advertising through the subject, style,
   and design of an advertisement.^[42] The feeling of longing for the
   past is easily communicated through social media and advertising
--
   experienced a specific event or moment in time in order to feel
   nostalgic for it. This is due to a phenomenon referred to as vicarious
   nostalgia. Vicarious nostalgia is a feeling of wistful yearning for a
   moment that occurred prior to, or outside of, the span of one's memory,
   but is relatable (has sentimental value) due to repeated mediated
   exposure to it.^[43] The constant propagating of advertisements and
   other media messages makes vicarious nostalgia possible, and changes
   the ways we understand advertisements and subsequently, the way
   consumers use their purchasing power.

   Examples of nostalgia used to provoke public interest include
   nostalgia-themed websites^[44] such as The Nostalgia Machine and
   DoYouRemember?, and revamps of old movies,^[45] TV shows, and books.
   Vintage, rustic and old-fashioned design styles can also be seen in
   nostalgia-based ad campaigns that companies such as Coca-Cola and Levi
   Strauss & Co. use.^[43]

   Developed within the marketing discipline, forestalgia[1], defined as
   an individual's yearning for an idealized future, serves as a
   future-focused counterpart to nostalgia.^[46] Like nostalgia, where
   only the happy memories are retained, forestalgia explains customers’
   intentions to escape the present to a romanticized future where current
   concerns are no longer an issue. Marketing researchers found that when
   promoting hedonic and utilitarian products, far-past nostalgia and
   far-future forestalgia advertisements were most effective in the
   promotion of utilitarian products. In contrast, hedonic products were
   better suited for advertisements framed in far-past nostalgia or
   near-future forestalgia.
