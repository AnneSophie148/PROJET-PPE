   Often think about your past? Or wish you could go back in time and have
   the life you had? Or the world we all once had before the coronavirus
   pandemic? Nostalgia has direct implications on our mental health.

What is nostalgia?

     Nostalgia is a longing for our past, albeit a possibly romanticised
     version.

--
   even for a version of ourselves we once were.

   Nostalgia is different from homesickness, where we want to be in
   another existing space than the one we are in.

   And it’s not the same as fantasy, where we seek to substitute reality.
   With nostalgia, we know we are in the here and now. We are just
   indulging in a trip down memory lane, while wearing our ‘rose coloured
   glasses’.

When being nostalgic is a positive

   In the last century, researchers focussed on nostalgia as something
   negative. It was seen as an inability to accept the past or what we’ve
   lost, and something that stopped us from being in the present.

   But a flurry of more recent research now claims nostalgia as a mental
   health positive. The newer perspective on nostalgia is that it can help
   us feel:
     * more connected (we can remember good times with loved ones and feel
--
       a past, who belongs).

     Researcher Krystine I. Batch, creator of the ’Nostalgia Inventory’,
     analysed memories of resistance fighters in WWII next to current
     empirical research on the subject. This highlighted how nostalgic
--
     helped with accepting a new homeland.

Nostalgia’s dark side

   nostalgia So where does nostalgia go wrong? It’s now thought that there
   is more than one kind of nostalgia, and that not all kinds are helpful.

   Personal nostalgia is when we miss what we experienced in the past.
   It’s the type that leaves us connected and inspired to recreate such
   happy moments in the present and future.

     But we can miss things too soon. This is called ‘anticipatory
     nostalgia’. We miss and long for something before it’s even over,
     and it leads to sadness, worry, and anxiety.  An  American study
     released in 2020 shows that, as well as affecting our reaction,
     poorly timed nostalgia can also affect our ability to learn from our
     reminiscing.

--

   Another 2020 study published in the Journal of Personality and Social
   Psychology concluded that nostalgia can also be negative if it’s random
   and unconscious.

     Consciously making an effort to recall the past was found to elevate
     our moods. But everyday moments of nostalgia were found to be more
     likely to have a negative effect.

Can’t stop reminiscing?

   Are you the type who has daily random nostalgia? Always comparing the
   present unfavourably to the past? Can’t enjoy it when good things
   happen because you are so worried about how much you’ll miss things
   when it’s all over?

   Research and theory aside, you have to look at how nostalgia is making
   you feel. Constantly being caught up in nostalgia that leaves you
   feeling low can be a sign of other issues.

--

   There are unhealthy thought patterns that can be related to, or seem
   like, a form of nostalgia, but are actually signs of a mental health
   issue.

--
   Anxiety means we constantly worry about the future in a way that makes
   us feel fearful, and becomes increasingly illogic. If anticipatory
   nostalgia has started to make you tense and panicky, it might have
   become anxiety.

       I have always been quite a nostalgic person. During my life from
--
       think to myself, soak up these feelings of happiness, recollect the
       thoughts and sounds of the moment because nothing lasts forever and
       I know I will look back with nostalgia once it is all gone. Its
       like putting all in a bottle to open up at a later date. I suppose
       I`m acknowledging the happy situation I am in and that it can

       Is it possible that during addiction, you become more nostalgic? I
       was an addict, and ever since I’ve been clean, I’ve been anxious
       and I think that nostalgia has a lot to do with it(or at least some
       of it). I’ve been doing a lot of meditation including techniques
       for mindfulness, which helps tremendously. Honestly, I feel like a

       Hi Derek, we aren’t quite sure we understand the question. Do you
       mean nostalgic for the time before you were an addict, or for the
       time when you were an addict? Nostalgia can be for any time of our
       life, as every period of life has positives and negatives. Nothing
       is either all good or all bad. When we are an addict the positives

       that can feel like a family. There is nothing wrong with missing
       the good bits. that’s normal. But the thing that matters is not
       letting nostalgia blind us from remembering the hell addiction is
       as well. If it helps, keep a journal and write it all out. Perhaps
       write a list of all the positives you miss, but then all the
