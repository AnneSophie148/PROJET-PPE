Making America Great Again? National Nostalgia's Effect on Outgroup
Perceptions

--
       Richmond, VA, United States

   Nostalgia is a fond longing for the past that has been shown to
   increase feelings of meaning, social connectedness, and
   self-continuity. Although nostalgia for personal memories provides
   intra- and interpersonal benefits, there may be negative consequences
   of group-based nostalgia on the perception and acceptance of others.
   The presented research examined national nostalgia (a form of
   collective nostalgia), and its effects on group identification and
   political attitudes in the United States. In a sample of US voters (N =
   252), tendencies to feel personal and national nostalgia are associated
   with markedly different emotional and attitudinal profiles. Higher
   levels of national nostalgia predicted both positive attitudes toward
   President Trump and racial prejudice, though there was no evidence of
   such relationships with personal nostalgia. National nostalgia most
   strongly predicted positive attitudes toward president Trump among
   those high in racial prejudice. Furthermore, nostalgia's positive
   relationship with racial prejudice was partially mediated by perceived
   outgroup threat. Results from this study will help us better understand
   how the experience of national nostalgia can influence attitudes and
   motivate political behavior.

   rhetoric (Skelley, 2017). One concept repeatedly emerged within these
   discussions as a mainstay of Trump's political appeal: that of
   nostalgia, broadly defined as a bittersweet longing for the past.
   Evidence of Trump's appeals to an earlier time in American history have
   been cited from the beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign through
--
   voters' latent feelings of threat to their economic welfare, or to the
   racial or cultural homogeneity of American culture (Brownstein, 2016;
   Smeekes et al., 2020). On a broad scale, nostalgia focused on
   nationality is a prominent feature of right-wing populist party
   rhetoric, and evidence from voters in the Netherlands suggests that the
   emphasis of stigmatizing outgroups and preserving cultural hegemony
   within nostalgic messaging is what explains the link between nostalgia
   and right-wing populist support (Smeekes et al., 2020). In the United
   States, several studies provide strong evidence of a link between

   has of yet established whether Trump's nostalgic rhetoric may be
   associated with voters' attitudes toward racial outgroups. To this end,
   in this paper, we present evidence that national nostalgia, an emotion
   distinct from personal nostalgia, is associated with increased
   prejudice as well as support for the populist messaging of Donald
   Trump.

The Sociality of Nostalgia

   Nostalgia is a mostly positive emotion that increases self-regard,
   attenuates self-esteem defense, enhances meaning in life, increases
   perceptions of self-continuity, and lessens feelings of existential
   threat (Wildschut et al., 2006; Routledge et al., 2008). Most people
   report experiencing nostalgia on a regular basis (Wildschut et al.,
   2006) and often structure their present in anticipation of experiencing
   nostalgia in the future (Cheung et al., 2020). Nostalgia is triggered
   in various ways, including by music, scents, and reflecting on past
   momentous events (Barrett et al., 2010; Reid et al., 2015; Sedikides et
--
   et al., 2008).

   The social connectedness function of nostalgia is a primary avenue
   through which nostalgia confers positive psychological benefits.
   Although nostalgic memories are more likely to be evoked while
   experiencing negative affect (Wildschut et al., 2006) and loneliness
--
   memories seem to indirectly regulate these positive emotions by evoking
   and making more salient one's symbolic connections with others
   (Sedikides and Wildschut, 2019). For example, nostalgia felt in
   response to loneliness has been shown to reduce perceptions of
   isolation and low social support (Zhou et al., 2008). In organizational
--
   et al., 2015).

   Importantly, those who are more likely to experience nostalgia (i.e.,
   those high in personal nostalgia) are also more motivated to control
   prejudicial feelings and reduce their expression of prejudices against
   outgroups as a result of these positive benefits (Cheung et al., 2017).
   Four studies of Caucasian Americans examined the links between personal
   nostalgia and the expression of both blatant and more subtle prejudice
   toward African Americans (Cheung et al., 2017). They found that the
   link between personal nostalgia and prejudice reduction was mediated by
   feelings of empathy, suggesting that the experience of nostalgia offers
   advantages beyond the self.

National Nostalgia vs. Personal Nostalgia

   The link between nostalgia and sociality becomes more complex when
   considering nostalgia felt for one's group. Although nostalgia felt at
   the individual level confers both intra- and interpersonal benefits,
   group-based nostalgia appears to have a distinct psychological profile
   from personal nostalgia. Group-based emotions, as distinct from
   individual-level emotions, arise when individuals self-categorize with
   a social group and integrate the group into their sense of self (Seger
--
   Mastro, 2015).

   Group-based nostalgia—operationalized as nostalgia felt for events
   shared with one's ingroup, or collective nostalgia—can be experienced
   in a variety of social settings, including organizations, school
   classes (e.g., Class of 2021), cities, and nations (Wildschut et al.,
   2014; Smeekes, 2015; Green et al., 2021). Like individual-level
   nostalgia, shared memories can include notable events, such as a
   special performance (band or orchestra), graduation day, homecoming
   (college class), or sports championships (city). However, unlike
   individual-level nostalgia, group-based nostalgia can occur in the form
   of a longing for a past that individuals themselves did not experience,
   but rather one that was passed down through collective memory
   (Martinovic et al., 2017). Additionally, collective nostalgia has been
   shown to increase positive attitudes as well as an approach-oriented
   action tendency toward the ingroup relative to an individually
   experienced nostalgic memory (Wildschut et al., 2014, Study 1).
   Collective nostalgia also can increase group-oriented prosociality
   (e.g., willingness to volunteer or donate money to help the ingroup;
   Wildschut et al., 2014; Green et al., 2021). Collective self-esteem
--
   collective self-esteem, which, in turn, increased intentions to
   volunteer. Other research has found additional ingroup benefits to
   collective nostalgia, such a preference for domestic (vs. foreign)
   consumer products (Dimitriadou et al., 2019) and a promotion of
   collective political action (in Hong Kong; Cheung et al., 2017).
--
   an ordinary collective memory) were more willing to punish outgroup
   members who were unfair to an ingroup member (Wildschut et al., 2014,
   Study 3). However, in some cases, collective nostalgia might increase
   intergroup contact when individuals can feel collective nostalgia for a
   superordinate group (Martinovic et al., 2017). In a study of former
   Yugoslavians who had settled in Australia, Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs
--
   ethnic groups).

   National nostalgia is one type of collective nostalgia that is felt
   while self-categorizing as a citizen of a specific country, and is
   likely to be associated with particular intra- and intergroup attitudes
   and behavioral intentions. Just as personal nostalgia during times of
   change and upheaval can facilitate coping (e.g., attenuating
   loneliness) (Zhou et al., 2008), national nostalgia—a reverie for a
   country's good old days—may increase felt closeness to fellow natives
   during times of national stress or uncertainty. However, nostalgic
   revelry at the national level may exclude other citizens, such as
   recent immigrants or minorities (Smeekes and Jetten, 2019). Studies of
   national nostalgia among Dutch participants indicated that national
   nostalgia predicted prejudice toward religious minorities in the
   country (Smeekes et al., 2014) as well as prejudice toward Muslim
   countries (Smeekes, 2015). Notably, these outgroup attitudes were not
   predicted by personal nostalgia, which has been shown to be associated
   with decreased intergroup prejudice (Cheung et al., 2017). This
   distinction between personal and national nostalgia may lie in the
   extent to which outgroups pose an emotional threat to the self.

National Nostalgia and Outgroup Threat

   The intergroup threat theory (Stephan et al., 1999) posits that
--
   2a and 2b) prejudice toward non-White outgroups and pro-White
   attitudinal bias. One possible explanation on why national and personal
   nostalgia are associated with different intergroup attitudes may be due
   to different levels of social categorization evoked, leading to
   differing levels of perceived threat. Personal nostalgia, which is
   associated with continuity of personal identity (Sedikides et al.,
   2015a) and evokes strong feelings of social connectedness, also has
   downstream implications for reducing anxiety and hostility toward
   outgroup members (for a review, see Sedikides and Wildschut, 2019). In
   contrast, feeling national nostalgia is associated with
   self-categorizing at the group level, evoking one's national identity
   (Smeekes and Verkuyten, 2015). Similar to how personal nostalgia may be
   evoked when feeling disconnection at the individual level, national
   nostalgia has been shown to be evoked in response to existential
   concerns about one's group-based identity, and may have the beneficial
   effect of reducing anxiety by bolstering perceptions of group
   continuity and connection (Smeekes et al., 2018). For example, trait
   national nostalgia among Dutch participants was positively associated
   with wanting to protect national ingroup identity (Smeekes, 2015).
   Similarly, a cross-national survey across 27 countries found that
   existential concerns about the future of one's country predicted
   increased collective nostalgia, which in turn predicted greater ingroup
   belonging and anti-immigrant sentiment (Smeekes et al., 2018). However,
   when the presence or power of outgroups is salient (e.g., chronically
   or by the rhetoric of politicians), national nostalgia may increase
   perceived threat. Moreover, ingroup continuity may be threatened by
   consideration of outgroups (Smeekes et al., 2018). This may be
--
   distorted—for example, when whites in the United States feel a longing
   for a (whiter and more homogenized) past that never was. Thus, national
   nostalgia could increase this fear of the future, leading to increased
   prejudice.

--
   ethnic identities, we extended this line of inquiry by examining
   whether perceived intergroup threat explains any found relationship
   between national nostalgia and endorsement of symbolic prejudice.

National Nostalgia and Outgroup Perceptions in the Context of Political
Messaging

   Recent work has highlighted the prominence of national nostalgia in the
   rhetoric of right-wing populist political parties, and in particular
   its role in posing racial or national outgroups as scapegoats for
   perceived economic or cultural decline (Mols and Jetten, 2014; Smeekes
   et al., 2020). Political leaders often utilize national nostalgia in
   rhetorical strategy by emphasizing the discontinuity between a nation's
   past and present (Mols and Jetten, 2014), which then serves to evoke
   collective angst about group status (Smeekes et al., 2018). A content
   analysis of speeches by right-wing populist leaders in Western Europe
   found consistent themes of nostalgia for their country's “glorious
   past” while denigrating the country's present, as well as themes
   emphasizing that a) opponents of the party were the cause of this
--
   outlet for restoring psychological well-being by denigrating the
   outgroups believed to be responsible (Smeekes et al., 2018). Indeed,
   national nostalgia has been shown to explain support for right-wing
   populist policies and leaders via the denigration of immigrant and
   racial outgroups (Smeekes et al., 2020).
--

   To build upon this research, the aim of our study was to directly
   examine how voters' propensity to feel national nostalgia may explain
   support for Trump's populist rhetoric as well as increases in racial
   prejudice in the United States following the 2016 presidential election
--
The Current Study

   We examined the role of national nostalgia in propagating intergroup
   racial hostility above and beyond political orientation. We explored
   how national nostalgia relates to political and racial attitudes among
   voters who participated in the 2016 US presidential election. We also
   examined the interplay between national nostalgia, pro-Trump attitudes,
   outgroup prejudice, and perceived outgroup threat.

   office for some time, and whether the nostalgic message of “Making
   America Great Again” still resonated with voters. Minimal work on
   national nostalgia has been conducted, and to date, nearly all of this
   work has been conducted outside of the United States; thus, this
   research would explore the potential link between national nostalgia
   and political attitudes as well as study the phenomenon in the US
   sociopolitical landscape. In addition, we included a validated measure
   of personal nostalgia in order to better examine the association
   between personal and national nostalgia as well as to assess whether
   each type of nostalgia might be associated with political attitudes.

Hypotheses
--
   (https://osf.io/mwh6n).

   Hypothesis 1. National nostalgia would be positively related to
   pro-Trump attitudes (1a). No relationship was expected to be found
   between personal nostalgia and positive attitudes toward President
   Trump (1b).

   and racial prejudice be mediated by increased threat sensitivity?

Measures

Personal Nostalgia

   The Southampton Nostalgia Scale (SNS; Routledge et al., 2008) measured
   personal nostalgia, operationalized as how frequently participants
   experience nostalgia and how significant participants felt nostalgic
   experiences were to them. The scale included seven items (e.g., “How
   valuable is nostalgia for you?”) rated from 1 (Not at all) to 7 (Very
   much). To build on past national nostalgia research (Smeekes et al.,
   2014), we use a validated measure of personal nostalgia (proneness to
   feeling personal nostalgia).

National Nostalgia

   The National Nostalgia Scale (NNS; Smeekes et al., 2014, Study 1)
   measured participants' propensity to feel nostalgia on the basis of
   one's national ingroup membership. The scale included four items rated
   from 1 (Very rarely) to 5 (Very frequently) scale. The NNS used in this

   In terms of political attitudes, we wanted to assess positive sentiment
   toward the President as related to the experience of nostalgia.
   Therefore, we used a modified version of the State Functions of
   Nostalgia Scale (SFN; Hepper et al., 2012), which measures the extent
   to which nostalgia confers the positive benefits of social
   connectedness, well-being, self-regard, and overall positive affect.
   Each item was modified to assess how participants experienced these

   Table 1. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a series of hierarchical
   linear regression models and bootstrapped mediation and moderation
   analyses to assess the relationship between nostalgia (national and
   personal) and political and intergroup attitudes using SPSS v. 20 and
   Hayes' PROCESS macro v.3 (Hayes, 2013). Following these baseline
   models, we also support our findings using path analyses employing
   maximum likelihood estimation using IBM AMOS v. 26 (Due to a computer
   error, the national nostalgia data from 72 participants were unusable,
   reducing the n for analyses including national nostalgia to 193, still
   above the target based on the power analysis).

Main Hypothesis

   We first assessed whether national nostalgia and personal nostalgia
   would be related to pro-Trump attitudes in the ways previously
   predicted. National nostalgia and personal nostalgia proneness were
   entered simultaneously in step 2 of the model to identify their unique
   relationship with attitudes toward Trump. In step 1 of the hierarchical
--
   attitudes such that higher conservatism was associated with more
   positive attitudes of Trump, β = 0.59 t(192) = 10.08, p < 0.001. In
   step 2 of the model, national nostalgia was associated with more
   pro-Trump attitudes above and beyond political affiliation, β = 0.30,
   t(192) = 4.43, p < 0.001, supporting Hypothesis 1a. In contrast,
   personal nostalgia was not associated with pro-Trump attitudes above
   and beyond political orientation, β = −0.07, t(192) = −1.13, p = 0.259.
   Nostalgia predicted a significant proportion of variance in attitudes
   above and beyond political orientation, F[(2, 189)] = 9.90, p < 0.001,
   R^2Δ = 0.06.
--
   To examine this relationship in a consolidated path model^5, Figure 1
   displays Path Model 1, quantifying the relationship between national
   and personal nostalgia and race, political orientation, ethnic identity
   salience, and pro-Trump attitudes. The model fit the data somewhat
   weakly due to the lower sample size [χ2(1) = 23.01, p < 0.001; CFI =
   0.89; RMSEA = 0.34; SRMR = 0.03]. As shown in Model 1, Hypothesis 1 was
   again supported: national nostalgia predicted pro-Trump attitudes (β =
   0.24, p < 0.001), whereas personal nostalgia was unrelated to pro-Trump
   attitudes (β = −0.08, p = 0.156).
   FIGURE 1

   nostalgia, ethnic identity, and pro-Trump attitudes (Model 1). Note.

--

   We also examined whether racial identity salience qualified the
   relationship between national nostalgia and pro-Trump attitudes. A
   moderation analysis using Hayes' PROCESS macro (model 1) indicated that
   higher racial identity salience somewhat strengthened the relationship
   between national nostalgia and positive attitudes toward Trump, but
   only among White participants; ΔR^2 = 0.03, F[(1, 77)] = 3.94, p =
   0.051. Among those low in racial identity salience, national nostalgia
   was unrelated to attitudes toward Trump; b = 0.27, 95% CI = (−0.03,
   0.58). Those moderate [b = 0.43, 95% CI = (0.18, 70)] and high [b =
   0.64, 95% CI = (0.31, 0.97)] in racial identity salience showed a
   strong relationship between national nostalgia and pro-Trump attitudes.

   As a final examination of Research Question 1, a second path model
   (Path Model 2, Figure 4) was compared with Path Model 1 to again
   examine the interaction between nostalgia and ethnic identity (on
   pro-Trump attitudes), and the interaction between political orientation
   and race (assessing its relationship with ethnic identity). When

   on a continuous scale) was not significantly associated with ethnic
   identity (β = −0.08, p = 0.210). Additionally, the interaction term
   between national nostalgia and ethnic identity was no longer associated
   with pro-Trump attitudes (β = 0.13, p = 0.607). This suggests that for
   White participants, greater national nostalgia was associated with
   increased ethnic identity.

   political orientation and ethnic identity × nostalgia) on pro-Trump

Research Question 2

   We next examined whether national nostalgia was positively related to
   racial prejudice. Bivariate correlations indicated that national
   nostalgia was positively associated with both anti-Black racial
   prejudice measured by the Symbolic Racism Scale (SRS) as well as
   perceived realistic threat measured by the Realistic Threat Scale (RTS,
   see Table 1). To further examine the link between national nostalgia
   and racial prejudice, we tested whether racial prejudice moderated the
   link between national nostalgia and positive attitudes toward President
   Trump using Hayes' PROCESS macro (model 1) with 5,000 resamples. A
   significant moderation effect was identified. Participants reporting
   higher prejudice exhibited a stronger relationship between national
   nostalgia and pro-Trump attitudes; ΔR^2 = 0.05, F[(1, 178)] = 19.60, p
   < 0.001. Simple slopes were calculated and visualized using the
   interActive online utility, and are presented in Figure 5 (McCabe et
   al., 2018). The relationship between national nostalgia and positive
   attitudes toward Trump was non-significant at low levels of prejudice
   (those at least −1 SD below the mean of SNS). However, for those
   moderate to high in racial prejudice (0, +1, or +2 SDs above the mean
   of SNS), national nostalgia positively predicted pro-Trump attitudes
   (see Figure 5). Interestingly, this effect was found separately for
   both White [ΔR^2 = 0.03, F[(1, 77)] = 5.93, p = 0.02] and Black
   participants [ΔR^2 = 0.09, F[(1, 97)] = 17.44, p < 0.001], but there
   was no significant three-way interaction between national nostalgia,
   prejudice, and race (p = 0.14), so the results in Figure 5 are
   displayed for all participants.

Research Question 3

   Will the relationship between national nostalgia and racial prejudice
   be mediated by increased threat sensitivity?

   We last examined whether the relationship between national nostalgia
   and racial prejudice would be mediated by outgroup threat perception
   (measured by the Realistic Threat Scale, RTS). A moderated mediation

   European-American and African-American participants. As shown in Figure
   6, the model indicated a significant indirect effect of national
   nostalgia on prejudice through the mediator of perceived threat for
   both White/EA participants [β = 0.23, 95% CI = (0.12, 0.36)] and
   Black/AA participants [β = 0.22, 95% CI = (0.13, 0.32)]. The

   prejudice by outgroup threat perception, moderated by participant race.

   To examine this question in the context of a path model, Path Model 3
   (Figure 7) displays the proposed relationships between national
   nostalgia and racial prejudice. Model 3 showed a moderate fit with the
   data, χ(2) = 65.80, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.79; RMSEA = 0.41; SRMR = 0.07).
   When accounting for political orientation, race, national nostalgia,
   personal nostalgia, racial threat sensitivity, and racial prejudice in
   a structural equation mediation model, national nostalgia directly
   predicted racial prejudice (β = 0.21, p < 0.001), whereas personal
   nostalgia did not (β = 0.03, p = 0.581). The relationship between
   national nostalgia and racial prejudice was significantly mediated by
   threat sensitivity [indirect effect β = 0.18, 95% bias-corrected CI
   (0.10, 0.26)]. Interestingly, personal nostalgia also showed a weak
   indirect effect on national nostalgia via threat sensitivity, but in a
   negative direction [indirect effect β = −0.07, 95% bias-corrected CI
   (−0.14, −0.01)]. This suggests that greater personal nostalgia may
   weakly predict lower racial prejudice via reduced racial threat
   sensitivity.

Discussion

   In our study, national nostalgia was associated with more positive
   feelings about President Trump, as well as increased perceived racial
   threat among White respondents. In contrast, personal nostalgia was
   unrelated to support for Trump or perceived racial threat. When
   assessed in a path model, personal nostalgia was actually associated
   indirectly with lower anti-Black prejudice via decreased racial threat
   sensitivity. These findings align with evidence from samples outside
   the United States (e.g., Smeekes and Verkuyten, 2015; Smeekes et al.,
   2020) that personal and national nostalgia are distinct experiences
   with unique ramifications for intergroup attitudes and relations.
   Though our overall finding that national nostalgia predicted Trump
   support could reflect a strong semantic connection between Trump and
   its 2016 presidential campaign slogan, it also may point to the appeal
   of Trump's campaign—and its right wing, populist sentiments—among those
   initially prone to feeling national nostalgia. To better answer this
   question, our next analyses investigated more closely the relationship
   between national nostalgia and identity.

   Our first research question asked whether identity was associated with
   national nostalgia. We found partial evidence for this idea, as
   Republican participants expressed greater positive attitudes toward
   Trump. However, there was no evidence of a relationship between race
--
   Trump's messaging appealed mostly to White voters. However, although
   race itself did not predict support for the President, racial identity
   salience moderated the link between national nostalgia and pro-Trump
   attitudes. White Republicans felt more strongly connected to their
   racial identity than Whites who identified as either Democrats or
--
   that the threat to White identity, along with other related constructs,
   may influence political attitudes and may also offer an explanation on
   why leaders invoking national nostalgia may be so attractive to some
   individuals. This type of rhetoric typically emphasizes collective
   identity discontinuity in order to foment anxiety about the state of
--

   The role of intergroup attitudes was apparent when examining the
   relationship between national nostalgia and pro-Trump support. We found
   that national nostalgia significantly predicted racial prejudice and
   that this relationship was mediated by perceived outgroup threat.
   Interestingly, this mediational effect was found among both White/EA
   and Black/AA participants, although the lack of a significant
   interaction effect may have been due to lower power. Additionally, we
   found a stronger relationship between national nostalgia and pro-Trump
   attitudes among those who reported more prejudice toward Black
   individuals. These findings align with evidence that group emotions
--
   when outgroups are perceived to be a threat (Smith et al., 2007;
   Wildschut et al., 2014). In particular, these findings align with
   converging evidence that the content of collective nostalgia—what
   individuals perceive to be “the good old days” for their identity
   group—reflects salient sources of perceived threat (Wohl et al., 2020).
   This conceptual model, highlighting the content of collective
   nostalgia, also explains differences between the emotional outcomes of
   personal and national nostalgia. Whereas, personal nostalgia enhances
   feelings of belonging by evoking memories of positive intrapersonal
   experiences in the face of ostracism or loneliness, national nostalgia
   may enhance belongingness by evoking positive thoughts about the “good
   old days” when one's group was perceived to be higher in status or less
   threatened by outgroups. It is also possible that national nostalgia,
   like personal nostalgia, may enhance feelings of continuity in its own
   way, by allowing individuals to feel connected to a time in which they
   believed their ingroup identity was less threatened or somehow
   stronger. Recent work supports the notion that, analogous to personal
   nostalgia, enhancing feelings of self-continuity (Sedikides and
   Wildschut, 2019), national nostalgia is linked to feelings of ingroup
   continuity (Smeekes et al., 2018). A study across 27 countries found
   that national nostalgia was associated with stronger feelings of
   ingroup continuity (Smeekes et al., 2018); ingroup belonging but not
   prejudice (outgroup rejection) appeared to mediate this link. Since
   relatively little research on collective nostalgia, particularly
   national nostalgia, has been undertaken, future work should examine
   these questions via multiple methods, particularly longitudinal and
   experimental designs, which can identify whether and to what extent
   self-continuity is enhanced by (or itself predicts) collective
   nostalgia in response to outgroup threat.

Constraint on Generalizability
--
   Additionally, these considerations of intergroup threat perception and
   prejudice are most generalizable to White/EA and Black/AA social groups
   within the United States, and future analysis of national nostalgia
   should continue to assess different ethnicities, races, and other
   relevant social categories.
--
Future Directions

   These findings raise the question on whether national nostalgia stems
   from a desire by some to go back in time, due to perceived group
   identity threats. Future research should employ longitudinal or
   experimental methods, such as manipulating identity threat, to examine
   whether national nostalgia arises as a defense against perceived
   threats to one's ingroup. Relatedly, it is only recently that national
   nostalgia has been manipulated (Smeekes and Verkuyten, 2015; Wohl et
   al., 2020), as the majority of national nostalgia research has been at
   the trait level. Further work evoking national nostalgia in
   experimental contexts would allow us to better understand how this
   emotion interacts with intergroup attitudes, prejudice, and feelings of

   An additional question to be explored is the extent to which national
   nostalgia operates within specific cultures and nations. Although
   Trump's presidential tenure has ended, the importance of these findings
   is not constrained only to the rhetoric from his campaign. Rather, the
   use of national nostalgia in political communication is widespread
   (Mols and Jetten, 2014; Smeekes et al., 2020) and has far-reaching
   implications. Future research should examine the role of national
   nostalgia in shaping attitudes toward demagogues in a variety of
   settings and when considering a variety of societal outcomes. Our
   findings suggest that national nostalgia may influence intergroup
   attitudes as a group-based emotion broadly through evoking positive
   emotions about one's national group identity. However, the nature of

   recent history, and a call to return to a former time may imply a call
   for a return to a former and less egalitarian social hierarchy. Future
   research on national nostalgia should explore the nuances of this
   emotion and its expression among various ethnic and social groups in
   different countries. Expressions of national nostalgia may evoke
   intergroup hostility to a lesser extent within nations with different
   histories.

   National nostalgia, a form of collective nostalgic experience, is a
   promising lens through which to analyze attitudes, such as political
   and prejudicial attitudes, particularly when combined with assessments
   of identity salience and perceived outgroup threat. Research to date on
   national nostalgia is relatively new. Although this phenomenon has been
   studied elsewhere (mostly in European and Asian nations), this is the
   first study, to our knowledge, to examine the US political landscape.
   Personal nostalgia—a wistful longing for one's personal past—does not
   have the same associations with political and group attitudes, and only
   moderately correlates with national nostalgia. In contrast, national
   nostalgia, particularly in combination with white identity salience and
   outgroup threat perception, predicted both prejudice and political
   attitudes.

   There may be some irony in the possibility that national nostalgia may
   include beliefs for a past that never was; in this case, an America
   that was not as white as some recollect. Nevertheless, these national
