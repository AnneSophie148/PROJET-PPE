Why Does ’90s Nostalgia Feel So Good Right Now?

   At a moment when life is strictly digital, references to the last
   analog decade abound.

   Call it the Zuckerberg paradox: The more the 21st century is dominated
   by smart devices and social media, the more there is a collective
   longing for the 1990s, the decade that trumpeted the end of the
   millennium and marked the final gasp of a global culture about to be
   completely rewired by Big Tech. Everywhere you look, across music,
   fashion, film, and television, there seems to be a postmodern pining
   for a less plugged-in era.

   Few in the public eye wish they could turn back time as much as Adele,
   one of the music industry’s last remaining recording artists with a
   capital R. For the release of her latest album, 30, the singer
   persuaded Spotify to disable the shuffle button on all artists’ album
   pages, so that tracks would play in the chronological order of a vinyl
   record or CD. “This was the only request I had in our ever changing
   industry!” the singer tweeted. “We don’t create albums with so much
   care and thought into our track listing for no reason.” To drive home
   her point, she sells cassette tape versions of 30 on her official
   website.

   Victoria Christina Hesketh, better known by her stage name, Little
   Boots, takes a similar approach. Hesketh, who, like Adele, is in her
   30s, said her latest electro-pop single, “Landline,” is an ode to
   “being a teenager in the ’90s, when you would spend hours clogging up
   the family phone line to talk to your school boyfriend or girlfriends.”
   The slinky disco track came about during lockdown, when she and her
   friends were “doing quizzes and Zoom dance parties, and it reminded me
   how we used to cope before the Internet and computers,” she said. “The
   ’90s are like a warm, fuzzy sweater we can put on and feel reassured.”

   Like music, fashion has always looked back to move forward. This
   season, cargo pants and carpenter jeans appeared at Missoni; the idea
   of underwear as outerwear was revisited by Prada; and Miu Miu showed
   exaggeratedly cropped, cable-knit sweaters and low-rise, teeny-tiny
   khaki miniskirts with brown belts that called to mind
   turn-of-the-millennium teenybopper naughtiness. At Chanel, designer
   Virginie Viard, who staged her show with an old-school elevated runway,
   went for accessory-laden leotards and jaw-length bobs, echoing house
   signatures from 30 years prior. The then-meets-now mood was reinforced
   by the choice of Christine and the Queens’ cover of “Freedom,” George
   Michael’s huge ’90s hit, for the soundtrack.

   The trend is not limited to the runways. “Reinvention and Restlessness:
   Fashion in the Nineties,” an exhibition of Maison Martin Margiela’s
   hoof-shaped Tabi boots, Prada’s minimalist nylon backpacks, and other
   decade-defining high fashion, is on view through April at the Museum at
   FIT, in New York. “The World of Anna Sui,” a survey of the designer’s
   hippie-grunge staples and her inspirations from the era (think qipao
   dresses and Nirvana), is showing at the Mint Museum Randolph, in
   Charlotte, North Carolina, through May. “I’ve heard a lot of people
   comment that you could wear the clothes today, because they don’t seem
   like they’re from another period. That, to me, is a huge compliment,”
   Sui said. “People are missing the realness of that era, and how it
   wasn’t yet a manufactured or corporate thing.”

   bouquet after the 1995 Anna Sui ...

   Ava Nirui, the art director of Marc Jacobs’s Heaven line, which takes
   inspiration from Sofia Coppola’s 1999 indie opus, The Virgin Suicides,
   agreed. “The younger generation definitely romanticizes a time before
   the Internet,” she said. “The ’90s were the most ‘advanced’ pre-Web era
   in terms of culture, which is why it might seem so appealing to those
   who didn’t experience it.” Revisiting favorite moments of the past can
   also offer opportunities for thoughtful reexamination. As Colleen Hill,
   the curator of the FIT exhibition, combed through the museum’s
   permanent collection for a section of the show devoted to the “global
   wardrobe” (a term Hill said she cribbed from an early-’90s issue of i-D
   magazine), she encountered thorny threads to unspool. “The tricky thing
   is that many ’90s designs would be considered cultural appropriation by
   today’s standards,” she said. “Trying to navigate how a Chinese dragon
   on a Todd Oldham dress was viewed then, versus how it would be viewed
   now, is not an easy thing to do, but I thought it was really important
   to at least try to have that conversation in the exhibition.”

   At times, however, the ceaseless nostalgia feedback loop can feel more
   mind-numbing than eye-opening. Simon Rex, the ’90s adult-film twunk
   turned MTV VJ heartthrob, may be earning Oscar buzz at the age of 47
   for his portrayal of a washed-up porn star in Red Rocket, but does the
   world really need Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte pounding the Manhattan
   pavement, sans Samantha, in the Sex and the City sequel And Just Like
   That…? Queens, the ABC musical drama, stars Brandy Norwood; can it be a
   coincidence that her mid-’90s UPN sitcom, Moesha, was recently picked
   up by Netflix, and that her 1997 TV musical film, Cinderella, with
   Whitney Houston, is now available on Disney+? Then there is
   Twentysomethings: Austin, a new reality series billing itself as the
   true story of eight 20-somethings who set out to find success in life
   and love, while sharing a bachelor pad in Austin, Texas—or, as one
   Twitter user joked, “Not someone pitching The Real World to Netflix and
   getting it greenlit.” At least the creators of Peacock’s Saved by the
   Bell redux appear to be a little more self-aware. “That’s why we have
   all these reboots of teen shows from the ’90s. Get a new idea,
   Hollywood,” a character quips during an episode from the show’s
   current, second season.

   It is an inescapable reality that nowadays, whether in film, music,
   television, or tech, those corporate behemoths that Sui said were not
   pervasive in her heyday are the ones churning out more and more tokens
   of ’90s faux-thenticity. Nintendo now offers a paid subscription
   upgrade to its popular Switch Online console, giving users the chance
   to play classic games from Sega Genesis and Nintendo 64, like Ecco the
   Dolphin, from 1992, and Mario Kart 64, from 1996. Amazon has its very
   own “90s throwback” section, complete with Smashing Pumpkins double CDs
   and enzyme-washed replicas of original Aaliyah commemorative
   merchandise. Even Hasbro makes “grown-up” Play-Doh packs engineered to
   evoke the buttery popcorn smells ubiquitous at Blockbuster video stores
   in the ’90s.

   Makeovers are often more successful in the hands of Generation Z. For
   her debut album, Sour, the 18-year-old pop powerhouse Olivia Rodrigo
   has used imagery that oscillates between the Total Request Live
   sensuality of Britney Spears during her 1999 ...Baby One More Time
   ascent and Courtney Love’s punk-prom aesthetic from Hole’s seminal 1994
   album, Live Through This. On a personal level, the singer has been
   serving leggy luxury straight out of Cher Horowitz’s wardrobe in
   Clueless; think of her Instagram selfies in body-hugging plaid babydoll
   dresses, or her much-publicized visit to the White House last July, in
   a vintage Chanel spring 1995 tweed suit.

   Arbiters of cool from the past represent “individuality, personal
   expression, and subcultures that were demonized by adults in their
   day,” said the fashion and culture researcher James Abraham, who
   created @90sanxiety, an Instagram handle that has amassed more than 2
   million followers with its meticulously curated feed overflowing with
   everything from an early Xanax advertisement to stills of Halle Berry
   from the 1997 camp classic B.A.P.S. It’s also significant that icons
   from that period, like Kurt Cobain and Debut-era Björk, were exempt
   from participating in the endless slog of daily content that is the
   norm today. Abraham pointed out that “there are only X number of photos
   of Kate Moss that exist from, say, 1993.” That, he said, makes them
   seem rare and “very pure, in a way.”

   The big business of a vintage vantage point is not lost on Abraham, who
   has given branding lectures at business schools and consulted for Nike.
   “Everyone is cycling back to things that they might have seen or done,
   because they are safe and tested,” he said. This is a foolproof formula
   for analytics addicts, whether they are Instagram archivists or Amazon
   chief executives. What the moody remix of Madonna’s 1998 ballad
   “Frozen,” which went viral on TikTok last year, has in common with the
   resale market for the classic Range Rover LSE from 1993 is that both
   are fueled by our shared memory bank. The end goal for companies and
   creators alike is to “tap into an existing audience,” Abraham
   explained, and capitalize on “the success of the original.”

   There is no doubt that this endless retro stream offers an escape to a
   time when a car phone was a rare luxury. But the very persistence and
   pervasiveness of today’s mass nostalgia is only possible, of course,
   thanks to the algorithmic engines driving TikTok, Netflix, and other
   Big Tech platforms—in other words, the very same online tar pits we
   dream of escaping. To quote ’90s icon Alanis Morissette—currently the
   subject of Jagged, a new HBO Max documentary—isn’t it ironic?
