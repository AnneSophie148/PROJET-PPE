   ’90s nostalgia – how we learned to love the unlovable?

   Until recently, it may have caused a feeling of slight embarrassment
   and distaste. Today, more and more designers are falling for the ’90s
   nostalgia.

   Business was booming. With the fall of the Soviet Union, the threat of
   the atomic war faded. And finally, you could get a Discman that would
   work when jogging in your new Nike shoes. MTV – the YouTube of the ‘90s
   – bombed our vision with brightly coloured clips for music suddenly
   filled with Casio synthesizers. A secret mission was carried out in
   Microsoft to design Comic Sans, a font all designers would hate, and
   all non-designers would use almost everywhere. In design, you could
   pour a bucket of magenta, and add a lot of yellow, and nobody would
   snort with disbelief. The ‘90s were a pain to any designer’s eyes…

The colourful but cheerful ’90s

   But apparently, it is much less painful for the contemporary soul. So,
   can we actually be feeling nostalgia for the design trends of the
   1990s? Well, the question can’t have any rational answer, because, any
   nostalgic feeling in design trends probably defies the laws of logic,
   going back to the power of the strong feelings we have attached to the
   cultural phenomena of the era. From a different angle though, the
   decade of the 1990s was far too rich in cultural phenomena to be simply
   summed up. Or covered by a conclusion about dominance splashing
   contrasting colours and oversized letters. We had Anti-design, Grunge,
   Groovival, and Memphis still holding on, and almost everybody thought
   of himself as post-something. So, like any nostalgia, the flashback to
   the 90s can actually relate to very different things and completely
   different foundations of design.

   Yet, there seems to be some sort of a comeback to the 1990s, usually
   combining artifacts of the era with typography and a strong colour
   palette:

Where does the ’90s nostalgia come from?

   It would probably require a lot of research to find out if and why is
   this happening. But fortunately, we can just sit back, watch what’s
   happening recently, and easily jump to hasty conclusions. These will
   probably be impossible to rationally support, but let’s just take a
   long shot. We miss the colourful ’90s because we got hit really hard.
   Historically and culturally, whatever is happening since 2020 makes us
   simply more and more depressed. Apocalyptic headlines of our
   functional, minimalistic, and user-friendly news channels are light
   years away from the shared optimistic feelings of the ’90s. To a
   certain degree, one might argue, that culturally, things started
   falling apart after the ‘90s, interrupted suddenly by 9/11, millennial
   culture, and the horrible discovery that we are not a global village.
   And having reached – what an optimistic thought! After the rock-bottom
   of lockdown, pandemic, and war pessimism, we simply would rather pour a
   bucket of magenta onto our white, minimalist, and ascetic website… just
   because.

   Nostalgia is a powerful and complex feeling. It adds emotion to
   seemingly distant artifacts of the past, which – quite honestly – must
   have had a completely different meaning and context 30 years ago. But
   when we get back to them now, we add a lot of emotional luggage to them
   and in effect, see this:

   Some of us might nostalgically produce an “Ohh” sigh, instead of
   wondering, what the hell is going on with this background? Because
   those of us who still remember the ‘90s remember the VHS covers and
   movie posters. They nostalgically come back to the memories of the
   times when ‘Friends’ gags were still funny. The thing is quite obvious,
   we simply connect good times with that era, regardless of whatever
   judgment the history of design would produce regarding its aesthetics.

   See how ’90s nostalgia can be seen today:

How to use nostalgia in brand communication?

   But let’s be less nostalgic for a while and think, what function could
   the comeback to ‘90s trends have on branding? And here, referring to
   ‘90s design will most likely have quite a significant effect, for no
   less than two reasons:
    1. They relate to the emotional sphere of the spectator (assuming, of
       course, their memory of the ‘90s is richer than watching Gummi
       Bears) and reach back to memories of the 1990s, which, generally
       have a positive connotation.
    2. They are different, brighter, and “louder” than quite a lot of
       contemporary designs.

   Last but not least, such a trip down the designer’s memory lane can
   simply be fun for the designer: “Hey, how about not making this one
   more minimalistic, and adding a pink cheetah pattern in the background
   instead?”*

   Coming back to the pragmatic question: whatever element of the past
   design is taken up by your brand to launch a new campaign, it actually
   might work from a scientific perspective. According to a study from the
   College of Business and Economics, Washington State University,
   consumers tend to rate nostalgia-themed advertisements better in
   comparison to non-nostalgic ads**. The question could be: why? And I
   guess we come back to my initial suspicion: relating to 90s nostalgia
   makes a lot of sense in the post-pandemic context. We might not be
   tired of all-encompassing usability, minimalism, and pristine
   typography. We might simply be tired of the contemporary events and
   basically anything related to them. In an era, when almost everybody
   considers the future uncertain, possibly dangerous, this kind of
   nostalgic comeback may seem to offer some relief. It may be hard to
   believe if you simply focus on the visual side. It makes sense,
   however, assuming that design is, was, and will always be much more
   than that!

   *Yes, I know it sounds bad, but sometimes, instead of overthinking,
   just design a pink cheetah pattern and have fun!
