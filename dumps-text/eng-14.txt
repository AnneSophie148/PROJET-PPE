   Rosy retrospection refers to the psychological phenomenon of people
   sometimes judging the past disproportionately more positively than they
   judge the present. The Romans occasionally referred to this phenomenon
   with the Latin phrase "memoria praeteritorum bonorum", which translates
   into English roughly as "the past is always well remembered".^[1] Rosy
   retrospection is very closely related to the concept of nostalgia. The
   difference between the terms is that rosy retrospection could be
   understood as a cognitive bias, whereas the broader phenomenon of
   nostalgia is not usually seen as based on a biased perspective.

   Although rosy retrospection is a cognitive bias, which distorts a
   person's view of reality to some extent, some people theorize that it
   may in part serve a useful purpose in increasing self-esteem and a
   person's overall sense of well-being. For example, Terence Mitchell and
   Leigh Thompson mention this possibility in a chapter entitled "A Theory
   of Temporal Adjustments of the Evaluation of Events"^[2] in a book of
   collected research reports from various authors entitled "Advances in
   Managerial Cognition and Organizational Information Processing".^[3]

   Simplifications and exaggerations of memories (such as occurs in rosy
   retrospection) may also make it easier for people's brains to store
   long-term memories, as removing details may reduce the burden of those
   memories on the brain and make the brain require fewer neural
   connections to form and engrain memories.^[citation needed] Mnemonics,
   psychological chunking, and subconscious distortions of memories may in
   part serve a similar purpose: memory compression by way of
   simplification. Data compression in computers works on similar
   principles: compression algorithms tend to either (1) remove
   unnecessary details from data or (2) reframe the details in a simpler
   way from which the data can subsequently be reconstructed as needed, or
   (3) both. Much the same can be said of human memories and the human
   brain's own process of memorization. Another reason could be that
   humans fear the unknown so that we often assume a situation will be
   worse than it ends up being.

   In English, the idiom "rose-colored glasses" or "rose-tinted glasses"
   is also sometimes used to refer to the phenomenon of rosy
   retrospection. Usually this idiom occurs as some variation of the
   phrase "seeing things through rose-tinted glasses" or some other
   roughly similar phrasing.^[citation needed]

   Rosy retrospection is also related to the concept of declinism, such as
   people saying "things were better in the old days" or "back in my
   day...". Declinism is particularly the predisposition, caused by
   cognitive biases such as rosy retrospection, to view the past more
   favourably and the future more negatively.^[4]^[5]^[6]

Research[edit]

   In one group of experiments, three groups going on different vacations
   were interviewed before, during, and after their vacations. Most
   followed the pattern of initially positive anticipation, followed by
   mild disappointment thereafter. Generally, most subjects reviewed the
   events more favorably some time after the events had occurred than they
   did while experiencing them.^[7]
