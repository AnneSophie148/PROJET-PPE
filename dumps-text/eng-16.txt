We once thought nostalgia was a disease, but it might be key to our survival

   To what end does the brain recall and reward old memories?

   We’ve all felt that jab to the soul you get from driving by your old
   high school haunts or hearing a tune you once danced to. But why is
   that bittersweet sort of reminiscence so universal?

   Modern neuroscientists and psychologists know that a healthy dose of
   nostalgia is good for you, at least if you’re recalling happy days. But
   there was no sweetness to cut the bitter sensation in 1688, when
   Johannes Hofer coined the word in his medical dissertation. A
   combination of the Greek words nostos, or homecoming, and algos, or
   pain, it was a special type of homesickness associated with soldiers
   fighting far-off wars—and doctors feared it could kill.

   Seventeenth-century physicians like Hofer worried such thoughts
   depleted a patient’s “vital spirits,” draining their energy and putting
   health at risk, says Susan J. Matt, a professor of history at Weber
   State University. In the 19th century, doctors debated whether
   nostalgia was a disease in its own right or something that exacerbated
   other conditions common among troops, like dysentery. Either way, they
   believed it could cause irregular heartbeat, fever, and, in rare cases,
   death.

   Our opinion of nostalgia has evolved since then, but the phenomenon
   still eludes understanding. “It’s a very mixed emotion,” says Frederick
   Barrett, a cognitive neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University. That
   makes it hard to shoehorn into existing psychological theory, which
   typically categorizes emotions as either positive or negative. And
   triggers—the cars, chords, or smells that blast you into the past—are
   extremely personal. When one person’s trash is another’s sentimental
   treasure, designing a standardized study is difficult.

   But we do know nostalgia has a marked effect on us: Imaging studies
   show us that these experiences have their own neural signature. In
   2016, Barrett reported that meaningful musical cues changed the
   activity of the substantia nigra, a reward processing center that makes
   the happy hormone dopamine. That same year, neuroscientists in Japan
   published their own study, which argues that the emotion is co-produced
   by the brain’s recall and reward systems. They found that nostalgic
   images tax the memory-managing hippocampus more than other sights, as
   people mine autobiographical details deep in the past. This mental
   effort pays off: As the hippocampus activates, so too does the ventral
   striatum, another of the brain’s dopaminergic reward centers.

   That longing for the past might be a protective mechanism, says Tim
   Wildschut, a professor of social and personality psychology at the
   University of Southampton in England. Since 2001, he and his colleagues
   have generated a growing body of evidence that individuals more prone
   to nostalgia are generally more likely to socialize, feel empathy, and
   find life meaningful. But their work also suggests a more primitive
   purpose for the feeling: The same neurology that makes us long for
   people and places we’ve left behind may have evolved to remind our
   ancient ancestors of pleasant physical sensations during periods of
   discomfort and pain. In a 2012 study in the journal Emotion,
   Wildschut’s team showed that lower temperatures make us more nostalgic,
   and that nostalgia makes us feel toasty even when we’re objectively
   colder—a bit of magical thinking that could help people persevere in
   situations that might otherwise feel hopeless. If remembering the
   warmth of the cave you last called home could trick you into feeling a
   little less freezing, you might just keep moving long enough to find
   shelter before your body starts to shut down.

   In the modern era of sweaters and central heating, research suggests
   that the occasional look backward can also give us a life-affirming
   boost in more-subtle ways: by increasing self-esteem and protecting
   against depression. Clay Routledge, a social psychologist at North
   Dakota State University, conducted some of the earliest experimental
   studies on reminiscing as a mechanism for emotional self-regulation.
   “We’re in this campaign for some sort of meaning in life,” Routledge
   says. When you feel anxious or inconsequential, memories can be a
   source of comfort. “These cherished experiences we’ve accumulated
   across time make our lives seem meaningful,” he says. Feeling nostalgic
   helps us access them.

   Sentimentality’s apparent power to jump-start one’s memory also seems
   to improve recall ability in people with Alzheimer’s and other forms of
   dementia. In 2011, Mary Mittelman, a researcher at New York University
   Langone Health’s department of psychiatry, founded the Unforgettables,
   a chorus for people with dementia in New York City. When the ensemble
   performs familiar tunes—think classic songs like “Ol’ Man
   River”—​participants, even some who struggle with regular speech, start
   to sing along. Some clinicians are trying to fold retro audio into
   formal dementia care, with curated playlists and personalized concerts
   put on by music therapists for patients and their families.

   New flavors of this sort of “reminiscence therapy” are emerging around
   the world. In 2018, London-based startup Virtue Health launched the
   virtual reality app LookBack, which allows headset-wearing users to
   visit memorable locations around the world, or just take a walk on a
   familiar beach. That same year, the George G. Glenner Alzheimer’s
   Family Centers opened its first Town Square, an adult daycare facility
   designed to look like a small town in 1950s America. Though LookBack
   and Town Square have yet to publish peer-reviewed data on the success
   of their programs, clients say the projects have helped seniors access
   dusty memories and reconnect with loved ones.

   Scientists need a lot more information to adequately characterize this
   complex and bittersweet human sentiment. But while centuries of doctors
   considered nostalgia a deadly disease, we now know how wrong they were:
   Our longing for a lost time can help us make it through today.
