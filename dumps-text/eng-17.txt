Historical Nostalgia

   Written by Rachel Van Zeumeren on April 9, 2015

   An interest in the past or rebellion against the present?

   Many people are particularly attracted to the past, and, for some, the
   feeling is so strong that they feel as though they were born into the
   wrong generation. Historical nostalgia is a yearning for a time in the
   past that you have not actually experienced; but is it the allure of
   the past that causes nostalgia, or is it a result of dissatisfaction
   with the present?

   It is common to be intrigued by the past. Fashion trends almost always
   come back in style, usually to older generations, dismay. Perhaps your
   celebrity crush is old enough to be your parent or grandparent, or they
   have already passed away. Maybe you have acquired a record collection
   bigger than your parents, it is easy to wish that concerts were as
   cheap as in the 70s, or that candy was still a penny, and to forget
   about the more dismal aspects of the past. The past tends to be
   romanticized, and perhaps, when one longs for another time, they forget
   about the technological, medical, and civil rights movements that have
   improved the lives of many.
   At one point or another, most people desire to be a part of a different
   time period. There is something nostalgic about the past that creates a
   romantic feeling about a time we have never experienced ourselves. At
   one point or another, most people desire to be a part of a different
   time period. There is something nostalgic about the past that creates a
   romantic feeling about a time we have never experienced ourselves.

   Psychologists have studied nostalgia through Woody Allen’s film
   Midnight in Paris. They come to the conclusion that the film uses
   historical nostalgia to tell a story about coping with the present. In
   the film, the main character Gil, played by Owen Wilson, leaves the
   unsatisfying present and travels to 1920s Paris, where he spends time
   with his artistic idols.

   “It was Gil’s journey through the past that helped him identify what
   was missing in his present and that gave him the courage to take steps
   to correct it,” said Dr. Krystine Batcho, a professor at Le Moyne
   College in New York.

   Jennifer Yalouf, a doctoral student in clinical psychology at the
   Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology, thinks nostalgia can
   be interpreted as a type of fantasy, and fantasy is generally thought
   of as a defense mechanism that allows someone to block out the bad in
   the present. For Yalouf, historical nostalgia is a form of escapism,
   because people turn to the past to escape in many ways, from
   participating in historical re-enactments to reading books, listening
   to music, or watching movies from bygone times.

   Woody Allen often uses nostalgia as a theme, as seen in Manhattan and
   Radio Days, but the films come to a realization that the good old days
   were not as good as one might think. In Midnight in Paris, Gil realizes
   that the past was not that golden, the future may not be that bad, and
   that it is up to him to live up to his full potential. Feeling
   disconnected with a generation and thinking you were born in the wrong
   era can be seen as a rebellion against the modern idea of time,
   history, and progress.

   We live in a generation when people are extremely critical of youth.
   With books like, The Dumbest Generation: How the Digital Age Stupefies
   Young Americans and Jeopardizes Our Future, Mark Baurlein argues that
   cyberculture is turning young people into “know-nothings.” We are
   painted as narcissists who tweet, take selfies, have lost our social
   skills, and can’t live without the internet. Technology isn’t
   inherently bad though, and more and more young people are using it for
   social activism. Craig Kielburger, co-founder of the youth development
   charity, Free the Children, works with socially conscious young people
   everyday. Kielburger says that this generation is tremendously engaged
   and intelligent. We are inheriting another generation’s daunting
   economic and environmental problems, and it’s up to us to fix it. It’s
   easy to be dissatisfied with the present and to long for another time,
   but we might as well try to change what we don’t like, because time
   travel has not yet been perfected, and we have the intelligence and
   ability to bring about change.
