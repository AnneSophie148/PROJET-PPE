   We all feel nostalgic sometimes. We wish we were back in a certain
   time, a certain situation, something that’s already happened. We suffer
   over something that’s gone now, something we had and then lost. Maybe
   it’s about a person, a group (collective nostalgia), an object, or an
   event.

   There are also two different kinds of nostalgia, and the difference is
   very important. The first kind is a positive feeling, a nice memory of
   an object that’s gone or lost to time. The second kind is a negative
   feeling. It’s a feeling of pain over something you can’t get back
   again, yet you hope for it to come back.

Nostalgia for people

   Probably the first thing you think of when it comes to nostalgia is
   desire for a loved one. Breakups, distance, or death are some things
   that give us that longing feeling. But nostalgia isn’t any less
   important when its object is a place instead of a person.

   There’s a word in Spanish to talk about that kind of nostalgia, the
   kind that mixes melancholy and wishing for your homeland: “morriña.”
   The word comes from the Galician language. They say that “morriña” is a
   longing for the land you come from. It means missing the place where
   you’re from, on top of whatever things, objects, and situations it
   calls to mind.

   “Look into my nostalgia and tell me what you see.”
   -Xavier Velasco-

Collective nostalgia

   There’s another kind of nostalgia for situations or things of the past.
   It’s called collective nostalgia. What it means is a shared longing for
   what society used to be like.

   At some point in our lives, we’ve all heard someone say “back in my day
   things were different.” But comparing two different time periods is
   never fair. Memory gets distorted over time, so you might end up
   longing for a past that actually never was. Your selective memory will
   only recall events that make you feel even more nostalgic.

   In some parts of the world, a good portion of the population harbors a
   longing for dictatorships. They talk about how great they were. They
   sigh about how there’s no firm hand in these modern times, crying out
   for a strong, charismatic leader who will make their nation great
   again.

   But obviously those longings leave out important parts of the past and
   present. They don’t think about all the freedoms that come along with
   that authoritarian regime being over. They never mention the crimes
   that people might have committed in the past they want back so much.

   These people live in their own little world, a total distortion of
   reality. And by fantasizing like that they end up glorifying the past
   and people in it. Just think about people who worship
   horrendous historical figures like Hitler or Mussolini. Even if they
   created some progress for their societies, the crimes they committed
   should bury any nostalgic feelings at all.

Nostalgia as motivation

   Collective nostalgia, being the group emotion that it is, can
   powerfully shape a group’s behavior. When you share a longing for a
   specific kind of world with the majority of people in your group, it’s
   much easier to act. And if a large group wants to bring the past into
   the present, they might turn to violence if their other methods don’t
   work.

   Collective nostalgia can sometimes be a good prediction for collective
   action. The more intense the group emotion is, the more likely it is
   people will take to the streets. They will be more likely to cry out
   for the thing they desire, their glorious past. But the relationship
   isn’t actually that simple, and emotions will completely control it.
   But those emotions will mostly be negative.

   Rage and contempt can end up mobilizing the group if they direct them
   towards other people. When one group feels nostalgic about how society
   used to be and decides that some other group is guilty and stopping
   them from reclaiming their past, negative emotions and defensive
   actions are even more likely. These actions range from things that fit
   into norms or laws to things that cross into illegal territory, like
   vandalism or violence.

Collective nostalgia for good

   But collective nostalgia doesn’t have to be negative. If the longing is
   about people’s old ideas of their country, they’ll have to think about
   how that country really was. Or even better, they’ll think about what
   exactly they long for about that country.

   If their nostalgia is about values like openness and tolerance, any
   actions they take will have more liberal goals. Granted, that doesn’t
   mean the methods they use to achieve those goals will be open and
   tolerant.

   If you have the ability to shape your nostalgia, make it your
   motivation to create a better world. Miss freedom and not restriction,
   miss diversity and not exclusion.

   The movie “Midnight in Paris” by Woody Allen explains nostalgia as the
   negation of the present through the life of its main character.
