   In two studies, we examined the association between nostalgia proneness
   (i.e., trait-level nostalgia) and importance of the collective self. In
   Study 1, we tested and supported the hypothesis that nostalgia
   proneness is positively correlated with relational collectivism, which
   entails an emphasis on one’s connections with close others and small
   social networks. In Study 2, we demonstrated that nostalgia proneness
   is also positively correlated with group collectivism, which emphasizes
   one’s membership in more abstract, larger social groups or categories,
   and was reflected in increased identification with a national ingroup.
   These findings offer insight into the nature of nostalgia proneness—a
   consequential and stable personality trait.

Introduction

   Nostalgia, “a sentimental longing … for the past” (Pearsall, 1998, p.
   1266), is an ambivalent, albeit predominantly positive, and social
   emotion (Hepper et al., 2012a; Sedikides and Wildschut, 2016; for
   historical overviews, see Batcho, 2013; De Diego and Ots, 2014). When
   people nostalgize, they feel connected with others in a way that
   enhances their perceptions of belongingness and acceptance (Sedikides
   et al., 2015, 2016; Abakoumkin et al., 2019). In nostalgic reverie,
   “the mind is ‘peopled’” (Hertz, 1990, p. 195). Mental representations
   of social bonds (e.g., family, friends, and partners) form the building
   blocks of nostalgic memories; important figures from one’s past are
   brought to life and become part of one’s present (Davis, 1979; Batcho,
   1998; Abeyta et al., 2015; Wildschut et al., 2018). As a result,
   nostalgia makes one feel loved, supported, and efficacious in social
   relations (Zhou et al., 2008; Wildschut et al., 2010). However, most of
   the research on the sociality function of nostalgia has been concerned
   with momentary or transient (i.e., state-level) nostalgia. In the
   present investigation, we focus on the role of trait-level nostalgia
   (i.e., nostalgia proneness; Sedikides et al., 2004; Wildschut and
   Sedikides, in press).

   The extant literature indicates that nostalgia proneness is positively
   related with various indices of sociality. High-nostalgia (compared to
   low-nostalgia) individuals value social inclusion. In an early study
   (Batcho, 1998), participants first completed the Nostalgia Inventory
   (NI; Batcho, 1995), which assesses nostalgia proneness across different
   aspects of everyday life. Specifically, participants rated how much
   they generally missed each of 20 items from when they were younger
   (e.g., “someone I loved,” “the way people were,” “my pets”). The
   average rating was used to classify participants as high nostalgia and
   low nostalgia by selecting the top and bottom 25% of the sample,
   respectively. Next, participants rated themselves on 10 aspects of
   personality, including the extent to which they preferred activities
   with people rather than alone. High-nostalgia (compared to
   low-nostalgia) participants reported a stronger preference to be with
   other people rather than alone.

   More recently, Juhl et al. (2020) showed the positive associations of
   nostalgia proneness with three core features of human sociality:
   empathy (Eisenberg and Strayer, 1987), attachment security (Mikulincer
   and Shaver, 2011), and prosocial or charitable behavior (Batson, 2011).
   Across five studies, nostalgia proneness was consistently associated
   with greater affective empathy (assessed with various measures; e.g.,
   “Seeing people cry upsets me”; Mehrabian and Epstein, 1972), including
   among young children. Moreover, the link between nostalgia proneness
   and affective empathy held when controlling for domain-level (Big Five)
   personality traits and did not vary significantly as a function of age
   or gender. Juhl et al. further showed that high-nostalgia (compared to
   low-nostalgia) individuals evinced greater attachment security
   (assessed with the Security subscale of the Attachment Style
   Questionnaire; e.g., “I trust other people and I like it when other
   people can rely on me”; Hofstra et al., 2005). Attachment security, in
   turn, mediated the relation between nostalgia proneness and empathy.
   High-nostalgia (compared to low-nostalgia) individuals were more likely
   even to donate money to charity when given the opportunity to do so,
   and this relation was mediated serially by attachment security and
   affective empathy.

   The distinctive sociality of nostalgia proneness is brought into sharp
   relief when nostalgia is contrasted with two other modes of thinking
   about one’s past: rumination (Rusting and Nolen-Hoeksema, 1998) and
   counterfactual thinking (Epstude and Roese, 2008). Cheung et al. (2018)
   examined how nostalgia, rumination, and counterfactual thinking are
   similar or different in terms of their relation with seven functions of
   autobiographical memory (i.e., usages of memory or motives to remember;
   Harris et al., 2014): intimacy maintenance (attaining symbolic
   proximity to close but absent others), teach/inform (transmitting
   insights about oneself or life), self-regard (carrying over effective
   problem-solving strategies to present action, clarifying one’s
   identity), bitterness revival (rekindling resentment for having been
   wronged by others), conversation (enlivening current social exchange),
   boredom reduction (counteracting tedium), and death preparation (coping
   with mortality awareness). The uniqueness of nostalgia proneness
   (compared to rumination and counterfactual thinking) resided in its
   comparatively strong positive association with intimacy maintenance and
   weak association with bitterness revival. Nostalgia-prone individuals,
   then, indicate that they use autobiographical memories to stay
   connected to loved ones and not to stir up bitterness toward others.

   In light of this cumulative evidence, we propose that nostalgia-prone
   individuals assign greater importance to the collective self. Whereas
   the individual self refers to those unique aspects of the self-concept
   that differentiate the person from others and distinguishes him or her
   within the social context, the collective self refers to those aspects
   of the self-concept that are shared with other members of the social
   groups to which one belongs and is based on social bonds to others
   (Sedikides and Brewer, 2001). Brewer and Chen (2007) distinguished
   between two forms of self-definition at the collective level, with
   distinct implications for psychological functioning. Relational
   collectivism refers to an emphasis on one’s bonds to close others and
   small social networks. Group collectivism denotes an emphasis on one’s
   membership in more abstract, larger social groups or categories. In
   Study 1, we tested the association of nostalgia proneness with
   relational collectivism (and individualism). In Study 2, we extended
   this line of inquiry by examining the link between nostalgia proneness
   and group collectivism, as reflected in (national) ingroup
   identification. Our overarching objective was to tighten the
   nomological net around nostalgia proneness and thereby better
   understand this consequential and stable personality trait (Wildschut
   and Sedikides, in press).

Study 1

   In Study 1, we used survey data available from the Longitudinal
   Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel. Participants
   completed measures of nostalgia proneness, individualism, and
   relational collectivism. The measures of individualism and collectivism
   incorporated a further, cross-cutting distinction between a horizontal
   and vertical orientation (Singelis et al., 1995; Triandis and Gelfand,
   1998). A horizontal orientation emphasizes similarities between oneself
   and others. Thus, horizontal individualism involves self-reliance
   without a desire to differentiate oneself by achieving high status, and
   horizontal collectivism emphasizes interdependence with others without
   submitting oneself to others. A vertical orientation emphasizes
   hierarchies and differences between oneself and others. Accordingly,
   vertical individualism involves distinguishing oneself through
   competition and status acquisition, and vertical collectivism involves
   subordinating and sacrificing oneself for the sake of one’s social
   relations. We hypothesized that nostalgia proneness would be positively
   related to both horizontal and vertical collectivism dimensions (but
   not to individualism dimensions).

Method

Data Collection

   The LISS panel^1 includes members of the Dutch general public selected
   based on a true probability sample of Dutch households. Panel members
   complete studies each month, and their responses can be combined across
   studies. Data collection is managed by CentERdata in Tilburg, The
   Netherlands. We assembled the dataset from three LISS studies.
   “Background Variables” (completed April 2011) contained demographic
   measures, “Nostalgia—part 1, wave 1” (completed November 2012)
   contained measures of nostalgia proneness, and “Self-Regulatory
   Orientation” (completed April 2011) contained measures of collectivism
   and individualism. Data for the “Background Variables” study are
   updated monthly, and we used the data collected in the same month as
   the “Self-Regulatory Orientation” study. The “Nostalgia” study assessed
   nostalgia proneness at six timepoints. We selected the timepoint (part
   1, wave 1) that was closest to the “Self-Regulatory Orientation” study.

Participants

   Eight hundred sixty-eight participants completed measures of nostalgia
   proneness, collectivism, and individualism, as well as demographic
   information (457 women, 411 men; M [age] = 52.13 years, SD [age] =
   16.40 years, Range[age] = 16–91 years).

Nostalgia Proneness

   Participants in the “Nostalgia—part 1, wave 1” LISS study completed the
   Southampton Nostalgia Scale (SNS; Barrett et al., 2010) and the NI
   (Batcho, 1995). For the SNS, they responded to seven items. Three of
   them measured the extent to which participants found nostalgia
   valuable, important, or significant (1 = not at all, 7 = very much),
   and four measured how frequently participants became nostalgic (1 =
   very rarely, 7 = very frequently). We averaged responses to create SNS
   scores (α = 0.94; M = 4.12, SD = 1.23). For the NI, participants
   indicated how nostalgic (1 = not at all, 6 = very much) they felt about
   20 objects (e.g., “someone I loved” and “my childhood toys”). We
   averaged responses to create NI scores (α = 0.93; M = 3.83, SD = 1.11).
   We used two measures of nostalgia proneness for the purpose of
   convergent validation (Campbell and Fiske, 1959; Wildschut and
   Sedikides, in press).

Individualism and Relational Collectivism

   Singelis et al. (1995) developed 32 items to assess horizontal
   collectivism, vertical collectivism, horizontal individualism, and
   vertical individualism (eight items for each dimension). Triandis and
   Gelfand (1998) subsequently adapted 27 of these items to assess the
   four dimensions. Participants in the “Self-Regulatory Orientation” LISS
   study completed 8 of these 27 items (2 items for each dimension). These
   eight items were selected on the basis of their high factor loadings,
   as reported by Triandis and Gelfand. Participants rated the items (1 =
   totally not applicable, 7 = totally applicable). We averaged responses
   to create indices of horizontal collectivism (“If an acquaintance gets
   a prize, I would feel proud,” “To me, pleasure is spending time with
   others”; α = 0.59; M = 4.77, SD = 1.25), vertical collectivism (“It is
   my duty to take care of my family, even when I have to sacrifice what I
   want,” “It is important to me that I respect the decisions made by my
   groups”; α = 0.63; M = 4.81, SD = 1.30), horizontal individualism (“I’d
   rather depend on my own strength than being dependent on others,” “My
   personal identity, independent of others, is very important to me”; α =
   0.70; M = 5.28, SD = 1.22), and vertical individualism (“Winning is
   everything,” “Competition is the law of nature”; α = 0.78; M = 3.36, SD
   = 1.39). The targets referred to in the collectivism items are not
   large social groups or categories, but specific interpersonal
   relationships or networks (e.g., family, friends, and acquaintances).
   Only one of the four collectivism items referred to groups (“It is
   important to me that I respect the decisions made by my groups”), and
   even this item alludes to relatively small social networks (i.e., “my
   groups”) rather than large collectives. For this reason, the present
   measures tap relational (as opposed to group) collectivism. We
   acknowledge that the reliability coefficients are lower than desired,
   particularly for horizontal collectivism and vertical collectivism.
   This is expected, given that each index comprised only two items. Low
   reliability attenuates effect size and, hence, reduces statistical
   power (Cohen, 1988). Fortunately, our sample size (N = 868) affords
   sufficient statistical power (>0.80) to detect even a small effect (r =
   0.10, two-tailed).

Results and Discussion

   We present zero-order correlations among study variables in Table 1. As
   hypothesized, both measures of nostalgia proneness (SNS and NI) were
   significantly and positively correlated with both (relational)
   collectivism dimensions (horizontal collectivism and vertical
   collectivism). The nostalgia proneness measures were also positively
   correlated with both individualism dimensions, albeit less strongly
   than with the collectivism dimensions.
   TABLE 1

   Table 1. Correlations among nostalgia proneness, collectivism,
   individualism, and demographics in Study 1.

   Consistent with prior findings (Singelis et al., 1995), the two
   horizontal dimensions (horizontal collectivism and horizontal
   individualism) and the two vertical dimensions (vertical collectivism
   and vertical individualism) were significantly and positively
   correlated. In addition, horizontal collectivism and vertical
   individualism were positively correlated, as were horizontal
   individualism and vertical collectivism. This overlap between the
   collectivism and individualism dimensions raises a legitimate question
   concerning their unique relations with nostalgia proneness. To address
   this, we first tested the partial correlation of each
   nostalgia-proneness measure with each collectivism dimension,
   controlling for the individualism dimensions. The positive associations
   between nostalgia-proneness measures and collectivism dimensions
   remained significant, when controlling for individualism dimensions. To
   be precise, the SNS was significantly correlated with horizontal
   collectivism (pr = 0.17, p < 0.001) and vertical collectivism (pr =
   0.21, p < 0.001), and the NI was also significantly correlated with
   horizontal collectivism (pr = 0.21, p < 0.001) and vertical
   collectivism (pr = 0.24, p < 0.001). Next, we tested the partial
   correlation of each nostalgia-proneness measure with each individualism
   dimension, controlling for the collectivism dimensions. The SNS was not
   significantly associated with horizontal individualism (pr = 0.01, p =
   0.751) or vertical individualism (pr = −0.02, p = 0.566), when
   controlling for collectivism dimensions. The NI was not significantly
   correlated with horizontal individualism (pr = −0.03, p = 0.470) or
   vertical individualism (pr = 0.04, p = 0.226) either.

   Finally, we examined correlations with demographic variables. Neither
   gender nor age was significantly correlated with either measure of
   nostalgia proneness. Women evinced significantly higher vertical
   collectivism scores and lower vertical individualism scores than men.
   Older (compared to younger) individuals scored significantly higher on
   vertical collectivism and horizontal individualism and lower on
   vertical individualism. When we controlled for age and gender (in
   partial-correlation analyses), the correlations of both nostalgia
   measures with both collectivism dimensions were practically identical.

   A key limitation of Study 1 concerns the exclusive focus on relational
   collectivism. This raises the question whether Study 1 findings can be
   replicated conceptually when collectivism is assessed in terms of one’s
   identification with more abstract, larger social entities. We tested
   this possibility in Study 2.

Study 2

   In Study 2, we examined the relation between nostalgia proneness and
   group collectivism. We assessed group collectivism in terms of
   participants’ identification with their national ingroup.

Method

Participants

   We tested 202 University of Thessaly students, who took part for extra
   course credit. We excluded four students because they were not Greek
   citizens, and six students because they did not complete all measures.
   The final sample comprised 192 individuals (188 women and 4 men),
   ranging in age from 18 to 40 years (M = 21.09, SD = 3.94).

Procedure and Materials

   Participants responded to the materials individually, on a computer. As
   in Study 1, we assessed nostalgia proneness with the SNS (Barrett et
   al., 2010; α = 0.91, M = 5.04, SD = 1.13) and NI (Batcho, 1995; α =
   0.87, M = 4.38, SD = 1.04). We assessed national identification with
   Leach et al. (2008) 14-item ingroup identification scale, which
   participants filled out in reference to their Greek nationality (1 =
   strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). The ingroup identification
   scale comprises two facets. (1) Group-level self-definition captures
   the degree to which individuals see themselves as similar to the
   ingroup prototype (i.e., self-stereotyping) and perceive ingroup
   members as similar to each other (i.e., in-group homogeneity). (2)
   Group-level self-investment encapsulates individuals’ positive feelings
   about their ingroup membership (i.e., satisfaction), the strength of
   their bond with the ingroup (i.e., solidarity), and the importance they
   ascribe to their ingroup memberships (i.e., centrality). We averaged
   across the relevant items to create indices of self-definition (e.g.,
   “I have a lot in common with the average Greek person”; α = 0.89, M =
   4.48, SD = 1.29) and self-investment (e.g., “I am glad to be Greek”; α
   = 0.89, M = 4.96, SD = 1.13).

Results and Discussion

   We present correlations between measured variables in Table 2. We did
   not include gender in the correlation matrix, because the sample
   included few men (n = 4). As hypothesized, both measures of nostalgia
   proneness were significantly and positively related to both group-level
   self-definition and group-level self-investment. Older participants
   scored lower on nostalgia (but age range was limited in this student
   sample). When we controlled for age (in partial correlation analyses),
   the correlations of SNS scores with self-definition (pr = 0.22, p =
   0.003) and self-investment (pr = 0.20, p = 0.007) remained significant,
   as did the correlations of NI scores with self-definition (pr = 0.16, p
   = 0.028) and self-investment (pr = 0.26, p < 0.001).
   TABLE 2
   www.frontiersin.org

   Table 2. Correlations among nostalgia proneness, group-level
   self-definition, group-level investment, and age in Study 2.

   Study 1 revealed that nostalgia proneness is associated with higher
   relational collectivism. Study 2 conceptually replicated and extended
   this finding by demonstrating that nostalgia proneness is also linked
   with higher group collectivism, as reflected in the strength of ingroup
   identification.

General Discussion

Summary of Findings

   Extant evidence has tied nostalgia proneness to a stronger preference
   for engaging in activities with others (Batcho, 1998), increased
   empathy (Cheung et al., 2017a; Juhl et al., 2020; Newman et al., 2020),
   and greater emphasis on intimacy maintenance versus bitterness revival
   (Cheung et al., 2018). The present findings tighten further this
   nomological net around nostalgia proneness. Our point of departure was
   Brewer and Chen’s (2007) influential distinction between relational and
   group collectivism. Whereas relational collectivism involves
   self-definition in terms of one’s bonds to close others and small
   social networks, group collectivism denotes self-definition in terms of
   one’s membership in larger social groups or categories.

   In Study 1, we examined the association of nostalgia proneness with
   relational collectivism (and individualism). This study further
   included a cross-cutting distinction between horizontal (i.e.,
   emphasizing similarities between oneself and others) and vertical
   (i.e., emphasizing hierarchies and differences between oneself and
   others) orientations (Singelis et al., 1995; Triandis and Gelfand,
   1998). Zero-order and partial correlations (controlling for
   individualism) revealed that high-nostalgia (compared to low-nostalgia)
   individuals scored higher on measures of horizontal and vertical
   collectivism. Zero-order correlations between nostalgia proneness and
   the individualism measures were small and rendered non-significant when
   we controlled for collectivism (in partial-correlation analyses). Study
   2, in turn, demonstrated a link between nostalgia proneness and group
   collectivism, as reflected in two aspects of (national) ingroup
   identification: group level self-definition (i.e., the degree to which
   individuals see themselves as similar to the ingroup prototype and
   perceive ingroup members as similar to each other) and group level
   self-investment (i.e., the extent to which individuals value the
   ingroup and their membership in it). Across both studies, independent
   assessments of nostalgia proneness (SNS and NI) produced convergent
   support for the conclusion that high-nostalgia (compared to
   low-nostalgia) individuals are more likely both to emphasize the
   importance of maintaining tightly knit networks of interpersonal
   relationships, including the attendant rights and responsibilities
   (relational collectivism), and to value, identify with, and promote the
   collective welfare of more abstract, larger social groups (group
   collectivism). The magnitude of these relations (Study 1: r range =
   0.19 to 0.26; Study 2: r range = 0.17 to 0.27) is typical for social
   and personality psychology research (Gignac and Szodorai, 2016; Funder
   and Ozer, 2019).

Limitations and Future Directions

   Our studies were correlational and, hence, did not allow us to examine
   direction of causality. However, prior research is consistent with the
   possibility of a bi-directional relation between collectivism and
   nostalgia proneness. Collectivism entails a strong need to belong (Bond
   and Smith, 1996; Suh, 2007) and there is now strong evidence that
   experimentally induced belongingness deficits, which heighten the need
   to belong (Hackenbracht and Gasper, 2013), lead to increased nostalgia
   (Zhou et al., 2008; Wildschut et al., 2010; Seehusen et al., 2013;
   Abakoumkin et al., 2017). Thus, collectivism may cause nostalgic
   reverie. Nostalgia, in turn, serves a compensatory role, assuaging the
   need to belong by strengthening social connectedness (for a review, see
   Sedikides and Wildschut, 2019). By so doing, nostalgia can increase the
   importance and strength of relational and group bonds. For example,
   discussing a shared nostalgic (vs. ordinary) memory with a close other
   (i.e., partner, friend, or family member) increases relationship
   positivity, intimacy, support, and mutual disclosure (Hepper et al.,
   2012b). Likewise, reflecting on nostalgic (vs. ordinary) events shared
   with other members of one’s university or national ingroup increases
   positive ingroup evaluations, charitable intentions toward the ingroup,
   and personal sacrifice for the ingroup (Wildschut et al., 2014), as
   well as ingroup bias in the evaluation of domestic and foreign consumer
   products (Dimitriadou et al., 2019). These findings point to a causal
   path from nostalgia to relational and group collectivism, particularly
   when one’s nostalgia pertains to, or is shared within, the collective
   in question. Explicating the bi-directional causal paths between
   nostalgia and (relational as well as group) collectivism presents a
   fruitful direction for research.

   Another unresolved question is whether nostalgia proneness, through its
   positive association with group collectivism, is linked to increased
   prejudice and ethnocentrism. To understand the nuanced picture emerging
   from extant findings, two issues deserve careful consideration. First,
   it is important to distinguish between nostalgia for experiences from
   one’s personal past (i.e., the focus of our present studies) and
   nostalgia for the ostensibly glorious past of one’s group (e.g.,
   national nostalgia). Proneness to nostalgia for one’s personal past is
   negatively correlated with prejudice against outgroups (Smeekes, 2015;
   Cheung et al., 2017a), and recalling a personally nostalgic (compared
   to ordinary) experience with a specific outgroup member reduces
   prejudice toward the entire outgroup (Turner et al., 2012, 2013, 2018).
   By contrast, nostalgia for the past of one’s group (e.g., “How often do
   you long for the good old days of the country?”) has been linked with
   higher prejudice, national glorification, and anger toward outgroups
   (Smeekes, 2015; Smeekes et al., 2015, 2018; Cheung et al., 2017b;
   Baldwin et al., 2018). Yet, findings by Martinovic et al. (2017) raise
   a second issue that requires attention, pertaining to the referent of
   nostalgia. Their findings indicate that, under certain circumstances,
   nostalgia for the collective past is associated with improved outgroup
   attitudes. Participants from former Yugoslavia rated their nostalgia
   for the Yugoslavia of the past (e.g., “I get nostalgic when I think
   back to Yugoslavia in the past times”) and then indicated their level
   of contact with members from different ethnic subgroups from former
   Yugoslavia (Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats). Nostalgia for the
   superordinate group, Yugoslavia, predicted increased contact between
   ethnic subgroups. Furthermore, political orientation might affect the
   referent of nostalgia. For example, political conservatives might be
   more prone than political liberals to nostalgize about the “good old
   days of a country” and thereby identify with this country. Clarifying
   the precise circumstances under which nostalgia proneness, in its
   different guises, is either positively or negatively associated with
   outgroup prejudice presents a challenge for future research.

Coda

   High-nostalgia (compared to low-nostalgia) individuals attach great
   value and significance to establishing, protecting, and enhancing
   close-knit interpersonal relationships, as well as to maintaining the
   integrity, and promoting the interests, of more abstract, larger groups
   and social categories. As history indicates, these pursuits can be the
   source of both great happiness and intense suffering. The present
   findings mark a step along the path to understanding these profound and
   sometimes contradictory implications of nostalgia proneness and human
   sociality.
