     Is Nostalgia the Enemy of the New?

        Hindsight is 2022: The Psychology Behind Our Cultural Nostalgia

   Look around and you’ll find it everywhere, from your TV to your dinner
   plate: a reverence for things past. But is it cute comfort or the enemy
   of the new? Here, our guide to navigating nostalgia, and how to look
   back while still forging ahead.

   Among his many other principles, Friedrich Nietzsche had this idea of
   “eternal return.” It means that time is cyclical, and everything that
   has happened will happen again, like a tape loop. As Nietzsche
   theorized it in The Gay Science, “This life as you now live it and have
   lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more;
   and there will be nothing new in it.” The philosophical question is
   whether this is a good or a bad thing. Such repetition could be either
   hellish or reaffirming, showing that life continues.

   Whether eternal return is real we can leave to religion. But we already
   experience it in American culture in the 21st century. As Nietzsche
   says, there is nothing new. Every television show, film, book, popular
   restaurant, and lifestyle fad seems to be a rehash of something that
   already happened. Culture is stuck on a loop: sequel after sequel,
   remake after remake, Spider-Man after Spider-Man. The plague of Marvel
   superhero movies was really just the harbinger of a grand, persistent
   nostalgia that seems to be our era’s preferred framework for consuming
   culture.

   Unable to imagine the future—as a result of the pandemic, climate
   change, social unrest, a sense of looming apocalypse—we return to the
   past. After all, the etymology of nostalgia comes down to a painful
   desire to return home.

   Sex and the City
   is back. Ryan Murphy is dipping into the well of midcentury mishegoss
   for a new Netflix series. Luca Guadagnino is remaking Brideshead
   Revisited for the BBC. Beyond the literal remakes, streaming services
   fight over access to nostalgic classics: Seinfeld, Friends, The Office.
   The rewatching of prestige TV series became something of a competition
   during the pandemic. At first it was Mad Men (itself a piece of
   nostalgia for midcentury New York), and then The Sopranos became the
   primary target, elucidated with essays and reconsiderations and,
   finally, a disappointing prequel film.

     Here’s the thing about indulging in classics: They provide
     experiences we know are highly unlikely to let us down.

   Like storylines, there are certain physical spaces we can’t resist
   returning to in hectic moments. These interiors are, without fail,
   familiar and cozy rather than austere or challenging. Take the French
   brasserie. It’s a classic with a constant whiff of the past, as if it
   exists on a separate timeline. One can barely penetrate the crowds at
   New York’s Balthazar right now—the flagship of Keith McNally’s
   design-as-comfort-food restaurants. The offspring it inspired
   (Frenchette, Le CouCou, Le Crocodile) are similarly choked with diners.
   Rickety stools are out; velvet banquettes are in.

   So are private clubs. London’s Casa Cruz is opening a six-story outpost
   on the Upper East Side, with a private floor for its investors only.
   The Britely, in Los Angeles, is a social club reviving old-school
   Hollywood glamour (chandeliers in the form of pink feather cascades)
   along with a menu from ’90s celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. Meanwhile,
   travel influencers prefer glamorous perennials like Paris and Lake Como
   to rugged, far-flung destinations.

   Here’s the thing about indulging in classics: They provide experiences
   we know are highly unlikely to let us down. At the moment we can hardly
   be blamed for such tendencies. The past two years have been frightening
   enough that guilty pleasures are more than justified. But nostalgia
   consumption comes with a cost. Too much has a way of impeding new
   culture, and there’s not much incentive to stop wallowing in it.
   Incidentally, even our most newfangled creations promote our obsessions
   with the past: Algorithmic social media feeds measure what we already
   engage with in order to recommend new content. Watch Bridgerton on
   Netflix, and suddenly every other Regency and Victorian-era series is
   at the top of your homescreen. TikTok’s “For You” feed provides only
   content that is familiar or universally inoffensive. The personalized
   echo chamber of political content is often lamented; our cultural echo
   chambers can be equally smothering.

   More worrying still is that this phenomenon has a deadening effect on
   creativity in general, because it’s harder to reach audiences with
   original ideas when technology is systematically weeding out anything
   unusual. With our digital cultural channels, art can be profitable only
   if it gets attention, and it can get attention only if it matches a
   preexisting pattern. That pattern is called nostalgia, and while it’s
   pleasurable, is it not ultimately boring? Per Nietzsche, we can be
   happy with the idea that life as a whole repeats, but no one wants to
   be doomed to the same TV show for eternity.
