CfP: Pop Nostalgia: The Uses of the Past in Popular Culture

   18/04/2016PostsTobias Becker

   Pop nostalgia, we are told, is everywhere. Our current golden age of
   television—from Mad Men to Vinyl, Downton Abbey to Call the
   Midwife—lovingly recreates earlier periods of the twentieth century,
   while club nights devoted to the 1980s or 1990s allow us to return to
   our youth. What is more, popular culture is, in the words of music
   journalist Simon Reynolds, addicted to its own past. It not only
   reminisces, it revives, reissues, remixes earlier forms and styles
   instead of coming up with genuinely new. Finally, our most modern
   technologies are always also time machines: producing sepia-coloured
   images of the present for an anticipated nostalgic recollection in the
   future.

   15391.books.origjpg These very different cultural phenomena, which are
   often subsumed under the term nostalgia, raise a number of still
   under-explored questions. How new is this development, given that
   period films are as old as the cinema and that popular culture and
   music has drawn on earlier periods as long as it exists? Can, contrary
   to Reynolds’ argument, the recycling of old styles and forms not also
   be highly creative and result in innovations? Are period settings and
   costumes, retro and vintage styles as such indicative and synonymous
   with nostalgia? Is it really nostalgia—a sentimental longing for
   yesterday—that drives our interest in and our engagement with the past?
   And if not what other motivations are at play? What role, for example,
   have media technologies such as film and the internet played in
   preserving the culture of the past in the present?

   These are some of the questions the workshop Pop Nostalgia addresses.
   It explores the uses of the past in popular culture across all media
   and genre, from literature, cinema, television, and video games to
   theme park, club nights and sports events. It is interested not only in
   representations of the past but also in their production and
   circulation as well as in audiences and reception. The workshop is
   particularly interested in the historical dimension of pop nostalgia,
   namely how it has changed over the course of the nineteenth and
   twentieth century.

   We welcome proposals for twenty-minute presentations from all
   disciplines and particularly encourage comparative and
   interdisciplinary perspectives. Please submit an abstract of no more
   than 300 words, along with a short CV, by 30 June 2016 to both Dion
   Georgiou (BSSH South Sport and Leisure History Network) at
   diongeorgiou@hotmail.co.uk and Tobias Becker (German Historical
   Institute London) at becker@ghil.ac.uk. The conference will take place
   from 10 to 11 November at the German Historical Institute London.
   Accommodation during the conference will be covered. Up to 100£ of
   travel costs will be reimbursed to those traveling within Europe; 800£
   for those traveling from elsewhere.

   Until the 1950s the term nostalgia primarily designated a pathological
   form of homesickness. Only from the mid-60s onwards did the new
   definition, a “yearning for the past”, find its ways into the
   dictionaries. At the same time intellectuals in the United States,
   Britain and West Germany observed a “nostalgia wave”. This diagnosis
   serves as point of departure for a research project at the German
   Historical Institute London on the popularisation of history in the
   1970s and 80s. This blog introduces the project, shares ideas and
   information and charts its progress.

   Noch bis in die 1950er Jahre hinein bezeichnete der Begriff Nostalgia
   in erster Linie eine krankhafte Form des Heimwehs. Erst Mitte der
   sechziger Jahre fand die “Sehnsucht nach Vergangenheit” Eingang in die
   Wörterbücher. Zeitgleich meinten Intellektuelle in den USA,
   Großbritannien und Westdeutschland eine “Nostalgie-Welle” zu
   beobachten. Diese Diagnose bildet den Ausgangspunktes eines am
   Deutschen Historischen Institut London angesiedelten Projekts über die
   Popularisierung von Geschichte in den 1970er und 1980er Jahren. Dieser
   Blog stellt das Projekt vor und hält über seine Fortschritte auf dem
   Laufenden.
