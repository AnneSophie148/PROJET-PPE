Chinese Consumer Trends: Nostalgia’s Role in Consumerism

   Have you ever listened to music you haven’t heard for a long time and
   started reminiscing about the good old times? Were there any toys you
   wanted but couldn’t get when you were a child? Were there any anime or
   shows that you loved watching during your childhood? Ahhh...memories..
   Nostalgia marketing is so successful because brands can quickly and
   deeply connect with audiences by revisiting pleasant memories. Research
   shows that the brain’s feel-good chemicals, dopamine, serotonin, and
   oxytocin, are activated at higher levels between the ages of 12 and 22,
   which is why we often feel a nostalgic yearning for items and
   experiences we encounter during our teenage and early adulthood years

   In our previous article and Instagram carousel, we already analyzed why
   Gen Z is a lucrative customer segment with the highest potential in
   China. Nostalgia marketing commonly targets millennials and Gen Zers,
   as they are now in the workforce of “Workism” societies saturated with
   highly educated and skilled workers. Although most of them are
   well-compensated at work, they are physically and mentally exhausted
   from working long hours and enduring the pressure and stress of immense
   competition. It is a social phenomenon that a lot of young adults have
   become desperate, sad, and lonely. When life lacks certainty and they
   feel they cannot set high expectations for the future, they tend to
   seek affirmation and happiness from the past.

   If you are a millennial, you are likely familiar with a lot of cartoons
   and anime like Space Jam, Doraemon, or movies from Ghibli studio.
   Millennials and Gen Zers in China love cute and cuddly things; they are
   obsessed with luxury items that incorporate childhood anime elements.
   “Shoppertainment” has also become a form of mental escapism for
   millennials and Gen Zers.

   But do you think their consumption is only confined to luxury bags,
   apparel, and shoes? It is much more than that. The younger generations
   have been exposed to multiple cultures, as they grew up during the
   golden era of digital transformations, watching different anime on TV
   and playing the latest gaming consoles. However, not all millennials
   and Gen Z could afford their childhood desires, this also shifts their
   consumption patterns on purchasing collectibles and toys that they
   could not get as a child. The chance to own an item we wanted as a kid
   allows us to satisfy our childhood wishes.

   There was a resurgence in the popularity of Pokemon cards worldwide in
   2020. During the pandemic lockdown, people stayed at home and thus had
   more time to reflect on their lives, doing things that they’d rarely do
   when they were already overwhelmed by daily responsibilities. We have
   all dreamt about time travel at some point as a kid, yet, is it
   possible for us to go back to our worry-free childhood? This desire to
   ‘feel like a child again’ drives us to revisit things that we used to
   be surrounded by in our childhood. You might watch your favorite
   childhood anime, dig out your time capsules holding all your childhood
   toys, or even spend a handsome amount of money to buy items they wanted
   as a child.. 77% of millennials and Gen Zers felt a desire to engage
   with comfortable content that gave them a break from the news, while
   73% reported that they spent money on collectible cards.

   A world-famous Youtube star who fought with Floyd Mayweather, Logan
   Paul, spent $2 million buying 6 Pokemon First Edition Base Set booster
   boxes which were released in 1999. 1 booster box contains 36 booster
   packs, each with 11 cards inside, for a total of 400 cards. He put 36
   of the unopened boosters packs for bidding via Goldin Auctions, and
   each pack was sold for $39,206 USD. The “Shadowless” Charizard with a
   “PSA 10 Gem Mint” rating was sold for $311,800 on eBay through PWCC
   auctions. Now, the “Shadowless” Charizard graded with PSA 10 has
   potentially reached $1M USD in value because there are only 3 in the
   world and Logan Paul wrapped it on his neck before his fight with
   Floyd, the card almost stole the show. Are you already going through
   the dusty sealed boxes in your basement? We won’t judge you. But the
   real question is: why is the old suddenly new again and worth so much
   more than before?

   Gary Vee, a world-famous serial entrepreneur who initiated the sports
   card hype, Pokemon cards, and collectibles, said: “After studying the
   card market for three years, I have this amazing feeling of conviction.
   All “cards”, especially the top 5% of vintage and rare cards, will go
   through a transformation similar to contemporary art’s transformation
   over the last half-century.” He also published quite a few YouTube
   videos preaching the lucrativeness and growth potential of sports
   cards. Most people collected cards as a kid but we grew out of it. But
   when social media power brokers like Gary Vee talked up trading cards,
   they have become culturally and socially relevant to most of us. Yet,
   is the endorsement of Gary Vee the direct causation of the white-hot
   card mania? Or do most of us have the desire for nostalgia deep inside
   our hearts?

   Nostalgia marketing is undeniably powerful. Burger King switched its
   logo to the brand used in the 90s this year.  People who are nostalgic
   tend to remember the good times and the personal meaning attached to
   these memories. With this logo switch, Burger King customers are
   prompted to remember the times they dated their high school crushes,
   where they shared the same burger and milkshake or the toys they
   received from the meal, rather than the burnt burger or cold fries they
   had.

   In China, Nostalgia marketing is also extremely effective on
   millennials and Gen Zers. The Chinese value collectivism, so as a
   culture, they tend to share collective memories and develop collective
   identities. When brands launch nostalgic marketing campaigns tailored
   for Chinese youth, the potential return is far greater than in
   individualistic societies. For instance, Scent Library collaborated
   with the iconic Chinese candy brand White Rabbit to create a distinct
   milky flavor fragrance. Chinese netizens were so excited about it, some
   even claimed the scent brought back some of their most cherished
   childhood memories.

   Now, we know nostalgia plays a crucial role in consumer behavior. Are
   you ready to tug at your audiences’ nostalgic heartstrings and take
   your brand to the next level? Send us an email at
