Nostalgia – is Missing the Past Good or Bad for You?

   nostalgia

   photo by Andrea Rico

   Often think about your past? Or wish you could go back in time and have
   the life you had? Or the world we all once had before the coronavirus
   pandemic? Nostalgia has direct implications on our mental health.

What is nostalgia?

     Nostalgia is a longing for our past, albeit a possibly romanticised
     version.

   We can be sentimental for people, experiences, places, and things, or
   even for a version of ourselves we once were.

   Nostalgia is different from homesickness, where we want to be in
   another existing space than the one we are in.

   And it’s not the same as fantasy, where we seek to substitute reality.
   With nostalgia, we know we are in the here and now. We are just
   indulging in a trip down memory lane, while wearing our ‘rose coloured
   glasses’.

When being nostalgic is a positive

   In the last century, researchers focussed on nostalgia as something
   negative. It was seen as an inability to accept the past or what we’ve
   lost, and something that stopped us from being in the present.

   But a flurry of more recent research now claims nostalgia as a mental
   health positive. The newer perspective on nostalgia is that it can help
   us feel:
     * more connected (we can remember good times with loved ones and feel
       cared for)
     * inspired to deal with the present (good things happened in the
       past, so trying to reach our goals means they might happen again)
     * like we have a stronger sense of self (we are a person connected to
       a past, who belongs).

     Researcher Krystine I. Batch, creator of the ’Nostalgia Inventory’,
     analysed memories of resistance fighters in WWII next to current
     empirical research on the subject. This highlighted how nostalgic
     memories counteracted loneliness, supported emotional and cognitive
     coping, strengthened social bonds and cultural identity, and even
     helped with accepting a new homeland.

Nostalgia’s dark side

   nostalgia So where does nostalgia go wrong? It’s now thought that there
   is more than one kind of nostalgia, and that not all kinds are helpful.

   Personal nostalgia is when we miss what we experienced in the past.
   It’s the type that leaves us connected and inspired to recreate such
   happy moments in the present and future.

     But we can miss things too soon. This is called ‘anticipatory
     nostalgia’. We miss and long for something before it’s even over,
     and it leads to sadness, worry, and anxiety.  An  American study
     released in 2020 shows that, as well as affecting our reaction,
     poorly timed nostalgia can also affect our ability to learn from our
     reminiscing.

   An example would be when we meet someone we really like, and we already
   feel sadness and a sense of longing when we think about when the
   relationship ends.

   Another 2020 study published in the Journal of Personality and Social
   Psychology concluded that nostalgia can also be negative if it’s random
   and unconscious.

     Consciously making an effort to recall the past was found to elevate
     our moods. But everyday moments of nostalgia were found to be more
     likely to have a negative effect.

Can’t stop reminiscing?

   Are you the type who has daily random nostalgia? Always comparing the
   present unfavourably to the past? Can’t enjoy it when good things
   happen because you are so worried about how much you’ll miss things
   when it’s all over?

   Research and theory aside, you have to look at how nostalgia is making
   you feel. Constantly being caught up in nostalgia that leaves you
   feeling low can be a sign of other issues.

When it’s a mental health issue

   There are unhealthy thought patterns that can be related to, or seem
   like, a form of nostalgia, but are actually signs of a mental health
   issue.

   Rumination sees you unable to stop repetitively focusing on things that
   distress you, and trying to figure out possible causes and consequences
   for them.

   Depression can mean we go over the past again and again, judging
   ourselves as unworthy and feeling consumed by guilt and self-hatred.

   Love and romance addiction can mean we think non stop about a person we
   met, or an ex, to the extent it affects our ability to cope. It can see
   us hiding things from family and friends.

   Anxiety means we constantly worry about the future in a way that makes
   us feel fearful, and becomes increasingly illogic. If anticipatory
   nostalgia has started to make you tense and panicky, it might have
   become anxiety.

   So lost in the past you can’t accept your current life? We connect you

   12 Responses to “Nostalgia – is Missing the Past Good or Bad for You?”
    1. Chris Longley
       I have always been quite a nostalgic person. During my life from
       adolescence to adult, being quite nostalgic about places or
       situations and seemingly even more nostalgic during unhappy times?
       Maybe that is because those places are linked to the happy times.
       I find myself re-visiting places of great happiness and joy and
       thinking back about the good times, drawing on those good feelings.
       But it can leave you feeling sad – of what is missing or lost now.
       As a child I would re-visit a place where I played with friends and
       had a happy or memorable time out of the mundane. Sometimes good
       things just happen with no expectations of it and you remember them
       more. Upon revisiting I was always left with a feeling of sadness
       for something that could not occur again or situation I want to be
       in now. I think it is comparison to the unhappiness verses the
       happiness of the here and now.
       Similar as an adult and often after a loss of something, revisiting
       somewhere of special memory or good feeling during a relationship
       or even a workplace event that was joyful. But I would go out of my
       way to reminisce there. Sometimes it can just be a piece of music
       or a smell to take me back to a moment in the past. “Baker Street”
       song takes me back to 1978 instantly. 2 stroke motorcycle exhaust
       fumes takes me back to the cafe in the harbour chatting up the
       young girl who worked there in 1982!
       It may sound foreboding but sometimes during really happy periods I
       think to myself, soak up these feelings of happiness, recollect the
       thoughts and sounds of the moment because nothing lasts forever and
       I know I will look back with nostalgia once it is all gone. Its
       like putting all in a bottle to open up at a later date. I suppose
       I`m acknowledging the happy situation I am in and that it can
       change but it is tinged with sadness knowing it will end.
       Nothing ever stays good does it.
    2. Harley Therapy
       Hi Chris. Maybe not – but on the other hand, nothing ever stays
       bad, really. Life is a flux over a static thing. It sounds like you
       have a romantic personality naturally. Some of us do. But we’d say
       that if your romantic thinking starts to stop you enjoying the
       present, then that could be rumination, an addiction to negative
       thinking. So worth keeping an eye on. Could be worth doing a round
       of CBT therapy, a short-term therapy which focuses exclusively on
       helping you control the link between your thoughts and your moods
       and doesn’t involve talking much about your past, just your current
       thinking. It would give you the tools to notice and manage when
       your thoughts are creative and romantic or when they are leading
       you towards low moods. It teaches tools of balanced thinking – how
       to get your thinking into a less black/white state. Best, HT.
    3. Andy
       I found myself being nostalgic and sentimental for family many of
       whom are long dead. I was doing genealogy at the time. I think this
       is a negative pass-time as it led me to become obsessed with the
       past and the people in it.
       I topped doing genealogy.
    4. Harley Therapy
       Andy, it’s good self awareness. If it made you unhappy, and you
       feel better now you’ve stopped, then seems you’ve made a choice for
       self care. Best, HT.
    5. Derek
       Is it possible that during addiction, you become more nostalgic? I
       was an addict, and ever since I’ve been clean, I’ve been anxious
       and I think that nostalgia has a lot to do with it(or at least some
       of it). I’ve been doing a lot of meditation including techniques
       for mindfulness, which helps tremendously. Honestly, I feel like a
       completely different person. I just wanted to get your thoughts on
       this.
    6. Harley Therapy
       Hi Derek, we aren’t quite sure we understand the question. Do you
       mean nostalgic for the time before you were an addict, or for the
       time when you were an addict? Nostalgia can be for any time of our
       life, as every period of life has positives and negatives. Nothing
       is either all good or all bad. When we are an addict the positives
       can be the camaraderie we have with other addicts, for example,
       that can feel like a family. There is nothing wrong with missing
       the good bits. that’s normal. But the thing that matters is not
       letting nostalgia blind us from remembering the hell addiction is
       as well. If it helps, keep a journal and write it all out. Perhaps
       write a list of all the positives you miss, but then all the
       negatives. And if you feel yourself faltering, don’t try to be
       brave, or think you are ‘such a different person’ you don’t need
       help. Reach out for support. It’s the strong thing to do, don’t let
       your head tell you otherwise….Best, HT.
    7. Diego
       Im trying to figure out how to deal with the “anticipaty nostalgia”
       im feeling right now. Every Olympics games I try to watch every
       sport cause I really enjoyed it, but sometimes I catch myself
       feeling sad when I see an athlete process from qualifications to
       final, and after the medals ceremony I get really sad cause it
       ended, also every time I feel sad for the Olympics to end before
       they are over. How can I deal with this, it’s really crazy. Thank
       you!
    8. Harley Therapy
       When we feel overly emotional over something outside of ourselves
       it’s often as we have a tendency to block emotions on a regular
       basis as we judge ourself and our emotions. So we find a venue
       where emotions are ‘acceptable’ and then let all our emotions out
       there. A classic example is someone who cries a ton when they watch
       a sad movie but are never emotional in real life. So we’d see this
       as an opportunity to process sadness, ask good questions, and take
       a deep dive into your own emotions. What is this sadness really
       about? Is it okay to just feel sad? Where in your life have you
       felt upset about something ending but then just hid your emotions?
       You get the idea. You might want to try journalling, we have an
       article on how to use journalling as self-help here
       http://bit.ly/journallingHT. Best, HT.

       I am a teenager going to a different school that none of my friends
       are going to and I am just thinking back on the past when I was at
       school with everyone from the start of my child hood have been
       looking back at all my pictures from this year and just wishing I
       could hop back into the picture even with COVID I have been doing a
       lot of fun events and having one of the best school years of my
       life. It all went by to quickly and I just guess I’m not ready to
       let it go.
   10. Harley Therapy
       Hi Layla, we get it. Change can be really hard, particularly if we
       are leaving behind friends we love! So it’s very normal to feel
       nostalgic, worried, and anxious. But the one thing that is sure
       about life is that it can surprise us, and that each situation
       always has some positives, even if there are challenges. Life also
       tends to unroll in a way that we always have the inner resources
       for, even if we don’t yet realise it. Stay open to what good things
       might come or this new experience, trust that you will find a way
       to deal with it, and until then, know that what you are feeling is
       normal and you just have to take it one day at a time. If you get
       really anxious or upset though, do talk to someone you trust about
       your worries. Sometimes just talking things through can help us
       feel so much better. We wish you courage! Best, HT.

       I feel nostalgic all the time, so much so I think it may be an
       issue at times..? BUT… lets be perfectly honest here, modern life
       is awful…. we keep being told (propaganda) by all western media
       that everything nowadays is awsome, well the truth is it’s not. The
       internet is a great tool, yet has taken over the planet and
       seemingly everbodies lives, social media..?? say no more about the
       damage that does, music made on computers and having no human ‘feel
       or soul’ comedy is practically dead because whatever you say you
       will ‘offend’ somebody somewhere on the planet, can’t buy a house
       or flat (apartment) unless you are already wealthy, cant afford
       rent because of house prices, and property has become an
       ‘industry’…. I could go on and on and on.
       The past had many many issues, but on the flip side there are
       actually a few things that are better nowadays such as better
       understanding of mental health for arguments sake, but generally if
       you go back thirty years or more ago, life was much much eaiser in
       many respects, such as an average working man could buy somewhere
       to live, jobs were generally full time and permanent, there wasn’t
       so much pressure on people to be ‘perfect’ as there is now with the
       ‘self help’ industry. In saying all of this I can fully understand
       that anybody over say… 45yrs..? would look back with nostalgic eyes
       on how life used to be, although it obviously can effect how you
       live and potentially thrive in the present. The big problem is that
       the future just looks so grim, bleak, and depressing.
   12. Harley Therapy
       Thirty years ago we’d still have the cold war, before that,
       Vietnam, before that, World wars, before that…. you get the
       picture. At any given point in time at some place in the world some
       people are going through hardship, in another, people are doing
       okay. The world is a pretty balanced place in this way. Written as
       someone over 45, and many people do not look back to the past only,
       but are very focussed on the present and future. What we are seeing
       here, in all honesty, has nothing at all to do with the past or the
       future or anyone else. It has only to do with your thinking. Not
       you, your thinking. You are not your thoughts, believe it or not.
       What you are showing is strong signs of what are called ‘cognitive
       distortions’ http://bit.ly/cognitivedistortionlist. It basically
       means your mind is stuck in an addictive pattern of negative
       thinking that is like a rut you can’t get out of, that creates a
       parallel reality you believe is the ‘real truth’ when it’s far from
       it. Instead it keeps one in a limited perspective that blocks
       everything out. It’s guaranteed to lead right to depression and
       often loneliness. But you can get out of it, and change your
       thinking, in fact there is a short term form of therapy that
       focuses on just that called CBT. FYI, we have no interest in anyone
       being perfect. Being human is messy. We are all messy. And there is
       nothing wrong with that. We all of us have days we think the earth
       is the worst place to be, and that’s okay to. What isn’t so great
       is being so stuck in that mindset you can’t get out and it’s making
       you miserable. Often this comes from the ways we were raised, or
       childhood trauma, or from cognitive differences. It’s not our
       fault. It’s just that our brain is ‘stuck’. In that case, reaching
       out for support is a super idea, as these things can very much be
       helped and changed. Best, HT.
