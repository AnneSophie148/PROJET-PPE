Those Happy Golden Years: Coping with Memories That Bring More Pain Than

   Nostalgia refers to those wistful, sentimental feelings that surface
   when you recall significant experiences, relationships, places, and
   other bits of the past.

   Often, nostalgia inspires positive emotions — a sense of meaningfulness
   or life purpose, social connection, and optimism. But it can have a
   downside, too — a lingering aftertaste with an unpleasant bite.

   Longing for the past (something you can’t reclaim) can fuel
   dissatisfaction with the present. Nostalgic depression, then, can
   describe a yearning colored with deeper tones of hopelessness or
   despair.

   Experts don’t consider nostalgic depression a specific subtype of
   depression. All the same, fixating on rosy memories of happier times
   and better days can affect your mood and motivation to make the most of
   your life in the present.

Once upon a time

   Experts did consider nostalgia a mental health condition at one point.
   Physician Johannes Hofer first used the term in the late 1600s to
   describe the anxiety, homesickness, disordered eating, insomnia, and
   other symptoms experienced by Swiss mercenaries during their time
   fighting away from home.

   By the 1800s, nostalgia was considered more of a melancholic depression
   tinged with homesickness and loss.
   In the late 1900s, sociologist Fred Davis began to draw clear
   distinctions between nostalgia and homesickness. Others took his work
   further, highlighting nostalgia’s possible consequences and potential
   benefits.

   The link between nostalgia and depression

   A glimpse of a familiar face, the refrain of a long-forgotten song, a
   faint fragrance that pulls at your memory — any of these can inspire a
   deep and pervasive longing for people, places, and things that are no
   longer part of your life.

   You can’t always trust those glowing snapshots, though.

   You see, memory fragments are just that: fragments. As the flowing
   sands of time wear them down, you’re left with an incomplete picture of
   the past.

   The pieces that remain usually aren’t entirely accurate, either. Your
   brain has a tendency to apply Instagram-worthy filters to your
   memories, which can render them softer and more appealing than the
   actual event.

   Say you’re riding your bike along the river. A chorus of frogs
   harmonizes with the soothing rush of water, and the evening breeze
   cooling your face carries the scent of rain. These sensations provoke a
   wisp of memory: biking past a similar river on your way home from high
   school, with nothing to do except grab a snack and retreat to the
   privacy of your bedroom.

   “If only life were that simple now,” you think wistfully. “School and
   homework were so much easier than work and everything else I have to
   do.”

   What you might not remember:
     * regular conflicts with your parents
     * difficulties to keep your grades high enough to earn a scholarship
       to a college far from home
     * pain of your first heartbreak

   So, why does that matter? What’s wrong with remembering the good times?

   Often, nothing. Still, getting caught up in an idealized rewrite can
   leave you comparing your present day to a past you didn’t actually
   enjoy all that much.

   This yearning can eventually factor into emotional distress, including
   symptoms of depression.

Worry and rumination

   Nostalgia might cast a longer shadow if you have a habit of worrying or
   often find yourself fixating on dark and unwanted thoughts.

   A 2012 study explored potential negative effects of nostalgia in a
   sample of over 200 adults. The participants, most of whom were
   university students, answered questions about their:
     * mood, including if they experienced anxiety or depression
     * tendency to worry
     * nostalgic memories, which they were asked to describe using visual
       imagery and other sensory details

   According to the results, participants who tended to worry more often
   also reported stronger feelings of depression and anxiety after talking
   about their past.

Sadness or regret

   Looking back on the distant past can provoke symptoms of depression
   when you believe the present doesn’t measure up.

   If you failed to achieve things you hoped to accomplish, your bright
   enthusiasm for the future may have long since sputtered out. Maybe you
   wish you could return to your youth, when you envisioned life as a
   sprawling blank canvas to fill with your dreams.

   You might even feel guilt, as part of your depression symptoms, for
   letting loved ones (or yourself) down by making promises you couldn’t
   keep.

   Research from 2020 exploring the effects of nostalgia on well-being
   called nostalgia a “mixed emotion,” one that can have both positive and
   negative effects.

   Through several diary studies, researchers found evidence to suggest
   that nostalgia can sometimes create a cycle of distress:
     * You might notice spontaneous nostalgia as you go about your day,
       especially after unpleasant events, like a fight with your partner
       or a bad day at work.
     * As a result, you might focus even more on the past and fixate on
       negative thoughts. Eventually, you could begin to feel sad, even
       somewhat depressed.
     * This distress can, in turn, prompt further nostalgia.

   What’s more, existing feelings of depression or sadness can lay yet
   another filter over the past. In other words, if you tend to get
   nostalgic when you’re already feeling down, your memories might further
   darken your mood.

Loneliness and loss

   Nostalgia often surfaces when thinking of loved ones, both those you
   haven’t encountered in some time and those you no longer spend time
   with.

   If you lost a friend or loved one and feel like you never got real
   closure, this nostalgia may feel even more distressing.

   Anticipatory nostalgia, or a longing for someone or something you
   haven’t yet lost, can also trigger anxiety and preemptive sadness.

   You might notice this feeling during a romantic weekend with your
   partner or a casual day relaxing with your best friends. Despite
   enjoying yourself, you know every day can’t be the same and find
   yourself missing them well before they’re gone.

   The upside of nostalgia

   All that being said, nostalgia isn’t always negative. In fact, experts
   have associated it with several positive aspects of emotional
   well-being:
     * A stronger, more positive self-identity. Your life experiences help
       shape your personality and define your sense of self. Looking back
       on the past can help you realize how you’ve grown over time.
     * Life purpose. Thinking of important goals you have accomplished and
       important experiences can remind you that life has value and
       meaning — even if it didn’t turn out exactly how you predicted.
     * Belonging and connection. Nostalgia may sometimes contribute to
       feelings of loneliness, but 2020 research also suggested it can
       help you feel more connected to others. Thinking of the people you
       love, for example, can help you remember just how much you treasure
       those relationships.
     * Motivation and inspiration. Recalling “better” days could help
       motivate you to regain that contentment, inspiring you to work
       toward goals and improve circumstances you aren’t happy with.

   Nostalgia could even inspire you to get help for depression.

   In a 2020 study, researchers created two different announcements for
   the campus counseling center for 148 university students living with
   depression. One announcement was specifically designed to trigger
   feelings of nostalgia.

   The students who watched the nostalgic announcement reported
   experiencing more positive emotions afterward. They also showed more
   interest in reaching out to the counseling center to get support.

   Coping tips

   If looking back on the past leaves you feeling distressed in the
   future, these strategies can help.

Keep things in perspective

   You might recall happy moments with your friends and think, “I’ll never
   feel so close to anyone again.” Or, when thinking of an apartment you
   loved, you might think, “I’ll never live in such a nice place again.”

   Instead of letting the filtered past sway you, try probing your
   memories a little deeper for a more realistic picture.

   Yes, you and your friends did have a lot of fun — doing things you
   don’t have much interest in now. Plus, when you really consider your
   bond, you realize it wasn’t nearly as strong as the ones you have now.

   And, sure, that apartment was lovely, with great light and spacious
   rooms. Of course, you could hear every move your upstairs neighbors
   made, and your shower was almost never the right temperature (two
   problems you don’t have in your current apartment).

Mindfulness

   Taking time for mindfulness may benefit you when nostalgic thoughts
   provoke worry and rumination, drawing your mood into a downward spiral.

   Mindfulness, or consciously focusing your awareness on the here and
   now, can help you remember that any negative feelings coming up are
   just passing thoughts, and they have no power over your life now.

   You might recall your child’s first words and steps fondly, wishing you
   could still pick them up and cuddle with a bedtime story. When you find
   yourself mourning those long-ago moments, try reframing them. Instead,
   marvel at the fact that they can now read to you (and do so much more).

   Sitting with your memories, and any thoughts they bring up, can also
   help you find deeper meaning in the past.

   Instead of drawing comparisons between “now” and “then,” harnessing
   your nostalgia can help you cultivate gratitude for defining life
   events or people who truly changed your life.

   Working toward greater mindfulness? Give these tips a try.

Seek out fulfilling relationships

   When nostalgia leads to yearning for lost friends and loved ones, you
   can challenge feelings of loneliness by turning toward the important
   people in your present.

   New relationships might not replace the bonds that mattered so much.
   They can, however, remind you that you do have love and companionship,
   and that others value you, just as you value them.

   It’s also worth taking the chance to reach out to those people you miss
   most. Time changes nearly everyone, so you might find your friends,
   like you, have become entirely different people. Still, that doesn’t
   mean you can’t reconnect and perhaps even find something new to share.

   Seeking support

   A mental health professional might not diagnose nostalgic depression,
   but they can offer support when nostalgia leads to lingering emotional
   distress.

   Depression often affects your energy, not to mention your relationships
   with others. Connecting with a therapist is always a good idea when
   ruminating on thoughts of the past makes it difficult to thrive in the
   present.

   Some evidence suggests spontaneous nostalgia, or the recollections that
   come up in daily life, tends to have more of a negative impact than the
   nostalgic feelings that come up when someone asks you to recall a
   meaningful time in your life.

   Therapy can help when you notice:
     * anxiety or frequent worries
     * frequent rumination
     * guilt or shame
     * loss of motivation
     * persistent sadness, hopelessness, or despair
     * feelings of unworthiness or self-doubt

   A therapist can offer guidance by helping you:
     * recognize potential triggers for these feelings
     * create strategies to counter rumination
     * explore strategies to cope with nostalgia productively
     * identify symptoms of anxiety, depression, or other underlying
       mental health concerns

   therapist.

   The bottom line

   Life only moves in one direction: forward.

   Nostalgic musings can give rise to lingering sadness that takes hold,
   creating a roadblock that grounds you in the past. But they can also
   serve as a compass, guiding you to the future you desire.
