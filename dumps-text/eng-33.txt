   Quick Navigation

   Nostalgia is a powerful feeling. It provides us with a sense of
   happiness and sentimental longing when we think about a fond memory
   from our past. Often when we reflect on old memories it can boost our
   mood and reduce stress. It has been shown that feelings of nostalgia
   can also help people feel valued, loved and enhances perceptions of
   social support when people are feeling lonely.

Listen To Old Music

   Listening to music from your childhood can often take you back to a
   time of your youth. It could be a song from your favourite movie,
   musical or even just a popular song during your school years.

   "Music evokes so many feelings in us, memories, nostalgia, things that
   are connected to our past"

   - Olga Kurylenko

   Music can reconnect us to a special moment in time - you may find
   yourself sinking into beloved memories and feeling 18 all over again!
   Many studies have shown that nostalgia can be used as a mood elevating
   technique; increasing levels of happiness and strengthening social
   bonds. A fun way to start a wave of nostalgia is by creating a playlist
   for life on Storii. Gather all of your old favourite songs that revive
   fond memories and categorise them on your Storii account. You also have
   the option to categorise your playlists by decade or by genre - it's
   entirely up to you. Our next blog post will take you through the steps
   of how to create a playlist on Storii, so stay tuned.

Look at Old Photographs

   Looking at old photos is another way to spark feelings of nostalgia.
   Photographs can often evoke emotions and allow you to relive your
   favourite moments. Retronaut is a great resource to find old historic
   photos which will allow you to reminisce by travelling back to a
   certain period in time. Alternatively, you can create your own life
   story and log your own thoughts, memories & moments that matter on
   Storii. This article (here) will help you organise and digitise your
   old photographs to store them in one secure, easily accessible place.

Watch Old Movies

   Think back to your old DVD collection, which movies could you watch
   over and over again? A few of our favourites include Grease, Dirty
   Dancing and of course the Disney classics. Watching a movie from your
   childhood or even seeing an old TV commercial can certainly spark that
   feeling of nostalgia. The BBC's archive of TV nostalgia has some great
   TV programmes for you to have a look at for free that will certainly
   take you back.

Play An Old Fashioned Game

   This is a fun activity to enjoy with your family that will give you the
   opportunity to share your love of your favourite childhood games. You
   could try playing an old fashioned game that was popular before
   technology took over. A few examples of outdoor games include; Chinese
   jump rope, hopscotch, hula hooping, roller skating or even a game of
   rounders. However, if you are wanting to stay indoors some great
   suggestions are cards, noughts and crosses or hangman.

Visit Your Old Neighbourhood

   Having a drive or walk around your old neighbourhood will most likely
   stir some old emotions and memories of growing up. Have a look around
   the shops you used to visit and your favourite locations. Take in the
   details and observe how things have changed over the years.
