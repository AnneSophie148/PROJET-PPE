     * Nostalgia is a familiar feeling, but there are actually two
       different types—reflective and restorative nostalgia.
     * Restorative nostalgia involves happy memories and associations with
       the past. When we feel restoratively nostalgic, we’re likely to
       feel motivated to seek out new and rewarding experiences.
     * Conversely, reflective nostalgia may often make us feel gloomy and
       disappointed, making it seem that the present moment doesn’t
       compare with our memories, preventing us from moving forward and
       making new positive experiences.
     * Though they might sound like polar opposites, both types of
       nostalgia can be empowering experiences, if we learn to harness
       their emotional power.
     * Feeling reflectively nostalgic can be counteracted by remembering
       that the present moment holds hope for us—we can make new friends,
       happy memories, or achieve success with a positive mindset.
     * Feeling restoratively nostalgic is a special sensation, one that we
       can treasure while still remembering that the grass always appears
       greener on the other side.

   Has an old photo, song, or smell ever resurfaced and brought distant
   memories surging back to you? The psychological rush of remembering
   days gone by has a bittersweet quality, one that can be difficult to
   express. We’ve all felt nostalgic, but we may not be as familiar with
   the two types of nostalgia: restorative and reflective. While
   restorative nostalgia makes us feel positive about our past and
   motivates us to seek out new possibilities and experiences, reflective
   nostalgia often leaves us upset and wistful, thinking that our best
   days are behind us.

   When we feel positive about memories from our past, studies indicate
   that our brains are rewarding or even bribing us into seeking out
   positive experiences in order to keep the good vibes flowing. In
   contrast, feelings of reflective nostalgia cause us to shut ourselves
   off to new possibilities; in this state of mind, we might actually be
   susceptible to developing depression or anxiety. Despite the
   drastically different ways that restorative and reflective nostalgia
   affect us, psychologists now know that our ability to recall past
   events isn’t very accurate. Most memories, good or bad (and especially
   those attached to strong emotions), are almost always distorted in some
   way.

   But as long as we don’t turn our backs on the present moment, or give
   up on the future, there’s nothing wrong with taking a restoratively
   nostalgic walk down memory lane. In fact, it could help set us up for
   success in our personal lives and prompt us to continually form healthy
   habits and relationships. The only thing to remember? The view in
   hindsight, whatever we see, isn’t real.

Reflective vs. Restorative Nostalgia

   Reflective nostalgia was first described in the 17th century when Swiss
   physician Dr. Johannes Hofer noted that soldiers who were stationed
   abroad would often long for their home country, experiencing a
   dejectedness that sometimes resulted in near depressive-like symptoms.
   Though not clearly understood at that time, the profound emotional
   effect of their memories could not be mistaken.

   When the past is viewed through the lens of reflective nostalgia, we’re
   typically closed off to the possibility of change and are reflecting
   back on old memories in order to seek refuge. We don’t see potential in
   the present moment because we’re overtaken by how much we miss the
   past. It’s common to feel reflectively nostalgic when:
     * Going through a breakup, divorce, or loss of a friendship
     * Grieving the death of a loved one
     * Experiencing failure, personally or professionally
     * Struggling with depression, anxiety, or other mental health
       conditions

   When the past is analyzed with rose-tinted glasses, we miss the whole
   picture. We forget the toiling, frustration, and dissonance involved
   with many of our memories, which can feel blissful in an illusory way.
   People may feel restoratively nostalgic when:
     * Celebrating an anniversary in a relationship, or getting together
       during the holidays
     * They wish to ignore certain aspects of the past
     * Achieving success in their personal or professional lives

   Regardless of whether you’re experiencing reflective or restorative
   nostalgia, it’s important to recognize and harness the emotional power
   of these unique psychological experiences. You can clear the haze
   associated with memory distortions from your train of thought by taking
   a moment to recognize how you feel about the memory in question.

How to Cope with Reflective Nostalgic Memories

   If you’re reflectively experiencing nostalgic memories, it’s prudent
   to:
     * Mentally pump the brakes before spiraling downward—but not too
       quickly. When a sour emotion surfaces while you’re reminiscing,
       you’re better off critically evaluating that memory. You might’ve
       made a mistake, said something disastrous, or been selfish. Perhaps
       the person you lost, the opportunity you missed, or the
       breakthrough moment that never came seems to be holding you
       underwater. Keep in mind, the situation probably wasn’t as bad as
       you remember it being.
     * Trust that there will be more chances to connect and prove
       yourself. The question is whether or not you’re open to new
       possibilities. Although most nostalgic memories are seen through
       rose-colored glasses, they’re an important way to remember that
       there are positive people and opportunities for us to yet
       experience. After all, the past is proof.
     * Consider whether it’s time to make new friends, find a new partner,
       or rekindle an old passion. If we want something that we used to
       have, we’ll need to work for it—and we have to accept that we’ll
       encounter at least some resistance in our efforts.

   Unlike restorative nostalgia, sensations of reflective nostalgia aren’t
   pleasant. Evaluate whether your negative emotions could be attached to
   an underlying mental health condition. Reflecting too long on adversity
   or negative experiences we’ve had can negatively affect our mental
   health. A therapist or counselor might be able to help you identify
   harmful thoughts or associations that may be clouding your view of the
   past.

How to Harness Restorative Nostalgic Memories

   When you feel the rush of restorative nostalgia, try to:
     * Soak it all in, but don’t dwell in the past for too long. If you’re
       thinking about lost friends, an old relationship, or a breakthrough
       career moment, the good times you’re remembering can be a
       motivating way to continue pushing forward, especially when life
       may seem to remove many relationships and opportunities from our
       lives over time.
     * Remind yourself that the best optimists are also realists.
       Adversity is an aspect of reality we often have to contend with.
       Just because what you’re able to recall seems amazing doesn’t mean
       that it’s an accurate depiction of that relationship, event, or
       opportunity. There were bad aspects, unique setbacks, and
       challenges attached to whatever you remember. Don’t make rash
       decisions based on nostalgic memories—there’s no going back.
     * Note that you could be exaggerating how “great” things were.
       Looking back might feel good and cast those positive social
       interactions, achievements, or settings in a golden light. This is
       great, but the present moment is all we have. Does your current
       life contain the things that you’re reminiscing about? Why or why
       not? Pondering this may reveal what and who makes us happy, as
       unique individuals.

   Feeling nostalgic can be an empowering experience or an overpowering
   wave. Yet if we slow down enough to process properly, we can take
   advantage of both reflective and restorative nostalgic moments. The
   biggest difference between these two psychological phenomena is how
   radically different they each affect our emotions. When those old
   memories come barrelling towards us, we can use them as our fuel—or
   succumb to viewing them as our failures.
