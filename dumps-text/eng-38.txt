The creative rise of Internet nostalgia

   As the early days of the Internet begin to inform creative practices,
   some of us are wondering: is it too early to feel nostalgic?

   Since the advent of the Internet some twenty years ago, users have
   experimented with a wide host of browsers and programs in their quest
   for digital best. With a constant cycle of updates and replacements,
   the original online frontier grows more and more distant.

   Yet as we move ahead, some of us are looking back in a bid to
   rediscover the classic face of computers and the Internet. Flying
   Toasters, the turning wheel of Netscape Navigator and other symbols of
   a time gone past are emerging in digital collage, textile design, video
   artwork and even puppetry.

   But is it all too soon?

   A sped up sense of nostalgia

   As artists explore the tumultuous history of the digital and create
   nostalgic works, some of us are questioning whether this resurgence is
   slightly premature. The phrase back in my day is usually followed by a
   spirited ramble of times when things cost a penny and milk was
   delivered to the door, not of when people used to ICQ each other and
   surf around with HotBot.

   On the surface, nostalgic sentiments spanning back to the cusp of the
   millennium may seem pre-emptive … until the wider context of online
   culture is understood.

   Mary Rachel Kostreva of Tight Artists HTML gallery believes that online
   cycles are accelerated in comparison to real world cycles. Browsers
   rise and fall, versions are superseded in mere heartbeats and
   universally adopted programs can disappear after just a few months.
    According to Kostreva a true sense of nostalgia can build up around
   this fast turn around of programs and systems. ‘I think/hope that there
   is always a certain level of sincerity to it, considering that most of
   us millennials grew up using the Internet and have fond memories of
   what it once was (and miss it to a certain extent).’

   Her Tight Artists partner Adam Bech Harms agrees. ‘Even though we may
   lose interest in a site, program, forum, etcetera, we were still highly
   engaged with it at one time. We have fond memories when it was at the
   height of our interest, when it “was still good.” Those are the
   memories that become romanticised and sentimental. The cycle of
   generating nostalgia mirrors the life-span of these online entities.’

   An extra sense of loss stems from the common user belief that the
   Internet is permanent. Digital artist KT Spit and others have found out
   over time that this is a fallacy. ‘We (especially women as a warning
   not to “overshare” ourselves) are constantly reminded that what’s
   online is forever, that the ‘net itself is an eternal/timeless but
   expanding entity and cannot decay. But actually it ages rapidly and
   often if you go find your history its not ‘active’ anymore,’ said Spit.

   As programs, access and content disappear, real feelings of emptiness
   emerge.

   ‘These are places, formats in which we have existed, and we have
   learnt, loved, LIVED online, and now so much of it is actually gone. It
   all went by so fast,’ said Spit.

   A sincere representation

   LA-based artist Christina Bercovitz is an inter-disciplinary artist and
   puppeteer who has incorporated classic Internet symbols in her
   creations. For Bercovitz, her experimentation with the forms and images
   of an early Internet, as in this handbag, is simply a way of adding
   more colours to the palette.

    ‘As the novelty of the new wears off, many people including myself are
   changing attitudes towards the new and old and instead of judging them
   as superior and obsolete we are seeing these technologies simply as
   different tools. A painter can choose from a variety of materials and
   techniques that have different aesthetics such as choosing to use oil
   or watercolour to create their art. A video artist can similarly choose
   between the different aesthetics of DSLR or Betamax.’

   Bercovitz believes that newer doesn’t always equal better, with many
   old technologies able to inform upon modern practice.

   ‘I don’t think it is nostalgia alone that is driving this love of old
   technology. I might have fond memories of Super Mario Kart but that
   doesn’t mean it’s not still awesome.’

   Her approach is genuine. For Bercovitz the adoption of early Internet
   and computer imagery is simply a way to move artistically forward with
   as many options as possible.

   A conflict of irony

   Despite a sincere feeling towards the computer culture of old, many
   works that incorporate its classic motifs can come across as ironic.
   According to Bech Harms, it takes more than a random collage of icons
   to achieve a work of art that is sufficiently engaging and evokes
   aesthetic response.

   ‘Nostalgia is really about the feeling the memories give you so I find
   it’s most successful when artists try and capture that feeling in the
   style of their work. Personally when I see Internet nostalgia used as
   subject matter I find the work to be flat and uninteresting. Nostalgia
   goes against critical thinking, it glorifies.’

   There are, however, artists who are purposefully cynical. Max Schreier,
   curator and associate director at DUVE Berlin is quick to label this
   approach as ultimately unfulfilling. ‘Why should an audience spend time
   thoughtfully considering a work if it comes from a cynical or ironic
   place? As an artist why would you present something that you inherently
   find tacky, low quality, or just bad and put it forward as a work
   without making a sincere effort to place it in a meaningful cultural
   position?’

   Yet some artworks seem to be both sincere and ironic at the same time.
   While this initially seems impossible, the sped up conditions in which
   Internet nostalgia emerged has helped to make this an actuality.

   According to Schreier, ‘As the rate of technological development
   exponentially speeds up, the distance needed from a certain event or
   technology to be nostalgic decreases. With that said that does not give
   us much time to consider the value of the things we become nostalgic
   for.’

   This can culminate in a nostalgic feeling that has confused or
   conflicting values. As images are engaged with in a heartfelt and
   idealistic manner they are at the same time iconified and enmeshed into
   a culture that subverts their original meanings and exposes the
   promises they failed to deliver on.

   This oscillation between both the sincere and the ironic is a valid and
   modern understanding, and one that is informing much post-Internet
   work.

   A metamodern understanding

   In an attempt to address this dual understanding, the cultural paradigm
   of metamodernism can be considered. Metamodernism moves beyond the
   previous scepticism of post-modernity to explain the contemporary world
   that has emerged from networked culture. Modernist ideals of hope and
   freedom are also acknowledged, distinguishing the paradigm from
   post-post-modernism.

   According to Dr Hila Shachar, Honorary Research Fellow in English and
   Cultural Studies at The University of Western Australia and co-editor
   of Notes on Metamodernism, ‘What we’re witnessing now is a much more
   “knowing” and self-aware re-engagement with past traditions that takes
   into account the legacies of postmodernism.’

   Metamodernism moves between skepticism and authenticity as a way to
   summarise the conflicted responses many feel towards the current world.

   Shachar’s co-editor, Luke Turner, believes that network culture is an
   area of conflict. ‘These new technologies have begun to bring about
   societal change, with technology able to collapse outmoded hierarchies
   of knowledge, and a new dawn of collaborative endeavour signaled by the
   commons and open-source culture. At the same time, with new monopolies
   being built and government surveillance seemingly out of control, the
   implications of technology on our civil liberties appear ominous.’

   By existing within this digital culture a swinging oscillation between
   hope and despair is intuitively assumed. Internet nostalgia relates to
   this by highlighting a recent past that is now obsolete through swift
   technological advancement.

   ‘Given the frustrations of current times, there is a very palpable
   sense of nostalgia for the unfulfilled promises of past utopian
   visions. In revisiting these moments, as we oscillate between former
   and future visions, there is perhaps a hope that we might come to
   realise something anew, and fulfil that elusive utopian dream.’

   There is also a keen understanding that these past promises led to
   nothing, adding a concurrent feeling of doom and mistrust.

   While Turner and Shachar both believe there is a huge amount of banal
   post-Internet artwork that doesn’t move beyond the post-modern sense of
   irony, they also recognise a vast amount of innovation and inspiration
   online that reflects a more complex understanding.

   Curator Schreier uses Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied’s One
   Terabyte of Kilobyte Age (below) as an example of work that addresses
   specific visual tropes of classic Internet.  ‘It is a beautiful archive
   of old geocities pages, that does a wonderful job of creating a
   comprehensive and non-judgmental survey of some of the first easily
   accessible HTML coding, and what people were able to do with a website
   in the late 1990s and early 2000s,’ said Schreier. While Lialina and
   Espenschied’s work is sincere, there is also a sense of conflict
   related to values of the subject matter that is inherently metamodern.

   Constant Dullaart is another artist Schreier recommends, whose
   iconography is so well researched the viewer may not recognise it is
   from another time at all. Dullaart’s work incorporates authenticity and
   paranoia in what could also be considered a metamodern approach.

   Whether examples of work with increasingly transparent metamodern
   values will arise over time is a complex question. As the Internet
   keeps growing and updating in exponential degrees a wide range of
   creative practices may emerge from different philosophical paradigms to
   deal with the emergent culture. Predicting how this will impact upon
   creative practice is a challenging task.

   Hmmm, perhaps we should ask Jeeves.
