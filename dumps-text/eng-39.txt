Trump has made America nostalgic again for a past that never existed

   As a Canadian, I sit at the edge of my seat every election night in
   America.

   Even though it is not my country, like many, I feel the magnitude of
   what’s at stake in a country increasingly divided over issues of race,
   gender, the economy and the coronavirus pandemic.

   While this has been the narrative of the past four years, America has
   always been a nation divided. This division was thoroughly examined in
   the New York Times 1619 Project, which sought to reframe the country’s
   history by placing plantation slavery and the African American
   experience at the centre of American history.

   Despite historical facts, what has made the Trump era unique in its
   divisiveness is the way in which his presidency has been marked by a
   stark failure to disavow white supremacy while discrediting African
   American attempts to reclaim their place in American history. He
   condemned the 1619 Project while paradoxically claiming that he has
   done “more for the African American community than any president with
   the exception of Abraham Lincoln.”

   While we may not know the winner of the election for some time, what
   was clear on election night is that Trump did better than pollsters
   predicted. Why was this race so close?

Different ideologies

   Trump and Biden could not be more different in terms of ideology. But
   when it comes to nostalgia, both candidates relied on a similar notion
   of returning America to a different time.

   For Trump, “Make America Great Again” has not only functioned as a
   political slogan, it has also morphed into a battle cry for his
   followers who yearn for a past that has never existed.

   Through repeated invocations, the slogan is not only a reference to the
   past but also a “structure of feeling” — a term cultural theorist
   Raymond Williams coined in the 1950s. The term describes the paradox
   between the reality of people’s lived experiences — with its intangible
   and undefined parts of cultural life — and the official, material and
   defined forms of society.

   In other words, MAGA has nothing to do with policy — hence why Trump’s
   re-election campaign had undefined policy objectives — but everything
   to do with how and what his followers “feel” and think about MAGA.

   Biden also has a brand of nostalgia and has played on the trope of an
   industrial America of yesteryear, where people work hard, love their
   families as they do their neighbours. It’s a place where “honest Joe”
   can acknowledge that some of the neo-liberal policies of the Democratic
   Party that he endorsed, including the 1994 crime bill, might have
   harmed African Americans — the very people whose votes he needed — but
   for which he, unlike Trump, is at least able to apologize and show some
   modicum of empathy.

   Biden’s selling point, then, was that “at least” he cares. Was that
   enough to win over African Americans?

Black men iffy about Kamala Harris

   Even with Kamala Harris, a Black woman (who also identifies as South
   Asian) on the ticket, African Americans have been divided about her
   loyalty.

   While Black women were excited about Biden’s pick, many Black men were
   not. That wasn’t because of policy decisions as a California senator,
   but because of her former job as California’s attorney general, and
   before that, as district attorney of San Francisco where, under her
   tenure, Black people made up less than eight per cent of the city’s
   population but accounted for more than 40 per cent of police arrests.

   So unlike the narrative of community organizing and activism that was
   attached to Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential run, a narrative
   that seemed to supersede his work as a senator, Harris’s past has
   seemingly overshadowed her Senate work, even as her votes have been in
   aid of Black America.

   The closeness of the 2020 election has much to do with the way in which
   both Trump and Biden have invoked an imagined past, a narrative that
   suggests America needs to perpetually look back instead of looking
   forward.

Looking backwards

   Obama’s 2008 slogans — “Change we can believe in” and the chant “Yes We
   Can” — were so powerful because they projected an air of possibility
   about the future, that things could improve and that voters had the
   power to make it happen.

   Trump’s “Make America Great Again” and Biden’s “Battle for the Soul of
   America” have nothing to do with the voters or their ability to create
   a future; instead, both slogans send the same message — there was a
   time in America where things worked, where the nation was untainted by
   division, and that it must return to.

   This act of forgetting reality by clinging to a fictive, golden-days
   past is reminiscent of the title-track of the 1973 film The Way We
   Were, starring Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford. The song, performed
   by Streisand, was a huge hit, No. 1 on the Billboard Year-End Hot 100
   singles in 1974.

   Most people don’t remember that Gladys Knight & The Pips also released
   an R&B cover of the same song in 1974. In the collective memory of The
   Way We Were, the song belongs to Streisand; it’s hard to even imagine
   anyone else singing that song. In other words, people forget details,
   but what gets remembered is the iconic. Streisand is an icon. (Knight’s
   an icon in her own right, but primarily among African Americans.)

Trump is iconic

   Similarly, Trump is an iconic figure whose fan worship has managed to
   literally trump the Republican Party itself. He has convinced his loyal
   following to cling to the past because it was simpler then, and it
   gives people a chance to live out that simplicity — however fictional
   Democrats believe it to be — over and over again.

   Our memories of the past do not matter; what matters in the Trump era
   is the rewriting of every line of actual historical fact. Biden has
   relied on empathy and sentiment to win back the presidency, to bring
   back a kind America with his numerous folksy “Bidenisms” while Trump
   has done what nobody thought was possible — he has confused the
   citizenry to the point where many likely can’t remember what the U.S.
   was like before 2016.

   While Trump likes to evoke Lincoln’s name, it was Lincoln who famously
   said: “A house divided against itself cannot stand.”

   America is divided. But the question is, when the dust clears and the
   ballots are all counted, will it still aspire to become the nation it
   so desperately tells itself (and the world) that it can be?
