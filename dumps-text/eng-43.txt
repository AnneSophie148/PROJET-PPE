Five Ways Nostalgia Can Improve Your Well-Being

Some recent studies suggest that experiencing nostalgia about our past can
make us happier and more resilient during times of stress.

   I often find myself nostalgic for days gone by—especially my young
   adulthood. Thinking about days when I could go backpacking with a
   friend on a moment’s notice or dance the night away at my wedding,
   without the constraints of child care or a limited energy supply, gives
   me a bittersweet feeling—a mixture of joy, sadness, and longing.

   While I find nostalgia pleasant overall and even inspiring, doctors and
   psychologists did not always consider it a good thing. Staying “stuck
   in the past” was often associated with being unable to adjust to new
   realities, like when soldiers were nostalgic for their faraway homes
   and experienced loneliness and dread. Not that long ago, some
   considered nostalgia to be a mental illness, akin to melancholy, which
   could lead to anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders.

   But more recent findings on nostalgia suggest it can be good for us,
   increasing our well-being, making us feel connected to other people,
   and giving us a sense of continuity in our lives. And it seems to come
   on naturally when we need to weather life’s difficulties. Rather than
   being a problem, nostalgia can help bring happiness and meaning to our
   lives.

   Here are some of the ways nostalgia can benefit us, according to
   science.

Nostalgia makes us feel socially connected

   Nostalgia about our past often includes recalling important people in
   our lives—people who cared about us and made us feel like we belonged.
   Certainly, my own nostalgic musings are centered around times when I
   was with the people and places I love. So, it’s not too surprising that
   recalling these special times would make us feel more connected to
   others, in general.

   In one study, researchers found that people who were asked to write
   about an event from their past that made them feel “sentimental longing
   for the past” felt loved and supported, and this, in turn, helped
   buffer them against loneliness. Another study found that when people
   felt nostalgic about times in their lives when they interacted with
   members of an “out-group”—for example, teenagers recalling fun times
   with older adults—they felt less prejudice toward that group.

   Nostalgia also seems to help us maintain our relationships. For
   example, one study found that inducing nostalgia helped people feel
   more optimistic about relationships in general and more willing to
   connect with friends. Another study found that when induced to feel
   nostalgia, people (especially those who find connecting with others
   easier) felt more able to offer emotional support to the people in
   their lives.

Nostalgia helps us find meaning in life

   A sense of meaning in life involves knowing that your existence matters
   and that your life has coherence or purpose. It’s something we all
   strive for in one way or another.

   Fortunately, research suggests nostalgia can be an important resource
   for increasing meaning, by highlighting central moments in our lives
   and giving us a sense of continuity.

   In one study, researchers compared nostalgia to two seemingly related
   forms of thinking about one’s life: recalling a positive past event or
   imagining a desired future. Focusing on an event that made them
   nostalgic led people to feel their lives had more meaning compared to
   imagining a desirable future. And, compared to both other reflections,
   feeling nostalgic reduced people’s need to search for meaning in their
   lives—they already felt life had meaning.

   In another study, people either listened to music that brought them
   back to a particular time or read lyrics to old songs. These nostalgic
   activities not only made them feel loved and socially connected but
   also increased their sense of meaning in life. And, when people read an
   essay that encouraged them to think that life had no meaning—which
   said, “There are approximately 7 billion people living on this planet.
   So take a moment to ponder the following question: In the grand scheme
   of things, how significant are you?”—they naturally turned to feelings
   of nostalgia for relief from that sense of meaninglessness.

   These findings and others suggest that nostalgia not only heightens
   your sense of meaning in life, but can act as a buffer when you
   experience a loss of meaning. And it may help you move forward in life,
   too. As one study found, nostalgia can increase your motivation to
   pursue important life goals, because it increases meaning—not just
   because it puts you in a better mood.

Nostalgia can make us happier

   Though it does seem to do just that—to boost our mood. Even though
   nostalgia is by definition a blend of positive and negative emotion,
   the positive tends to outweigh the negative, meaning we feel happier
   overall.

   In one very recent study, 176 university students were randomly
   assigned to a six-week nostalgia program where they were asked weekly
   to write about a past event that brought on “a sentimental longing for
   the past” (while a control group wrote about past events that were
   ordinary). Afterward, they reported on their levels of positive and
   negative emotions and how much the writing provided a sense of social
   connection, meaning, or connection to their past self. At different
   points in time, they also reported on their life satisfaction, feelings
   of vitality, and well-being.

   The researchers found that nostalgia was generally beneficial, leading
   people to experience more positive emotions, life satisfaction, and
   well-being, as well as fewer negative emotions—at least three weeks
   into the program. These benefits mostly disappeared after that—except
   for people who started the experiment already engaging in nostalgia
   regularly. For them, going through the nostalgia program brought them
   greater life satisfaction and fewer negative emotions up to a month
   later, possibly because the program was a better fit for them.

   A lot of the benefits on happiness may be connected to nostalgia’s
   effects on social connection and meaning. But it could also be that
   nostalgia helps us see ourselves in a truer, more authentic light.

Nostalgia puts us in touch with our authentic selves

   When thinking nostalgically about our past, we are the prime
   protagonists in our own life stories. Perhaps because of this,
   nostalgia helps us to see our lives as continuous and coherent,
   providing us with a sense of authenticity.

   In one study, when primed to feel nostalgic by writing about a time in
   their past, people saw their past self as an authentic representation
   of themselves. This, in turn, reduced their focus on meeting the
   expectations of others versus following their own, intrinsic
   expectations of themselves. In other words, it helped them be their
   authentic selves.

   The researchers also studied how threats to one’s sense of self might
   make people engage in more nostalgia. Half of the participants read
   this text: “Many people feel that they have two sides to themselves.
   One side is the person that they show to other people; the other side
   is their true self—that is, the person who they truly are deep down.”
   Then, they wrote about times in their lives when they’d found it hard
   to reveal their real selves to others. The other half of the
   participants wrote about their daily routines and when those routines
   were disrupted. Then, both groups reported on their positive and
   negative emotions, as well as feelings of nostalgia.

    Findings showed that people who focused on threats to their
   self-concept experienced more negative emotions, and in turn felt more
   nostalgic. This suggests that nostalgia helps put us in touch with our
   “real selves” and protects us against threats to our authenticity.

   Perhaps for this reason, engaging in nostalgia can lead to personal
   growth. At least one study found that feeling nostalgia made people
   feel more positively about themselves, which, in turn, made them more
   open to experiencing new things, expanding their horizons, and being
   curious—all signs of psychological health.

Nostalgia may help people who feel disillusioned or depressed

   Perhaps because of these potential benefits, people tend to engage in
   nostalgia when they are feeling down, lonely, or disillusioned. Many
   studies have found that nostalgia seems to protect people from negative
   mind states, bringing about a kind of emotional homeostasis.

   Of course, that doesn’t mean that nostalgia is always good or can’t
   have a downside. If nostalgia makes us spend too much time thinking
   about our past, it may prevent us from recognizing the joy in our lives
   right here and now. And, since we tend to engage in nostalgia when
   negative things occur, it could become an avoidance strategy that keeps
   us from dealing with present problems in more effective ways.

   Encouraging groups of people to feel nostalgic could also have negative
   consequences. For example, one study found that nostalgia made people
   more likely to believe political claims, regardless of their veracity.
   Inducing nostalgia could be an advertising ploy used to affect consumer
   behavior, which could lead to poor choices, too.

   Still, chances are that nostalgia is more a blessing than a curse, and
   a winning strategy for feeling better about ourselves. It can increase
   our connection to others, our sense of meaning in our lives, our
   authenticity, and our happiness. So, why not tune into nostalgia now
   and then? It may just help you meet the challenges of the moment.
