Will We Feel Nostalgia for 2020?

Elijah Teitelbaum | Issue 108

   Elijah Teitelbaum

   TWENTY-TWENTY WAS A CHALLENGING YEAR, to say the least. The world was
   thrust into a pandemic that affected every person on the planet,
   forcing governments, communities, and individuals to make difficult
   decisions about their actions and responsibilities. A reckoning with
   racial injustice further dismantled our assumptions about how and for
   whom our societies function. Differences and disagreements in our
   responses to this moment have stoked pre-existing divisions all around
   us.

   From the crucible of the present, where the future is foreboding and
   uncertain, it is understandable that the past offers an appealing
   refuge. History appears far more stable than it ever actually was; even
   the recent past has aged rapidly under layers of rose-tinted patina.
   Indeed, nostalgia is all around us these days. Old films are constantly
   being rebooted, the eighties are in style, and home-baking traditions
   have been rediscovered in lockdown.

   While seeking comfort in the familiar might seem simplistic, the ways
   we generate and consume nostalgia make it complex: how we perceive and
   connect to the past makes it an important medium for the cultural and
   political narratives which shape our communities. Art and popular media
   alike speak to how we fit the past into our present. A nostalgic way of
   seeing, hearing, and thinking profoundly shapes how we feel about the
   world around us.

   What were once ordinary ways communities came together—worship, bars,
   celebrations, guests—have accrued overtones of danger. We have had to
   rethink how to connect with one another, and nostalgia plays an
   important role here: when we are able to see that others share our
   affinity for the past, and that we locate common values there, we gain
   a language for our contemporary communities. Though we often think of
   our nostalgia as being for an irrevocable past, it is actually about
   our present imagination and concerns.

   Our communal attraction to nostalgia, our ways of fitting the past into
   the present, represent historical memory in flexible, complex, and
   often troubled ways. Sometimes we see this, and sometimes we don’t.
   Nostalgia’s simplification of the past is often overt and obvious, but
   our desires for the feel of a synagogue sanctuary or a Sunday brunch
   can be covertly nostalgic in ways we might not realize. Nonetheless,
   the relationship between history and memory remains constant: our
   nostalgia places our values first, then imagines histories which embody
   those values, independent of actual experience.

   Recognizing this relationship between community and history underscores
   that memory is perpetually flexible. The contemporary artist Shimon
   Attie speaks directly to this through his site-specific projections. In
   his series The History of Another (2002), he marks sites of memory
   throughout Rome by layering historical photographs on top of the city’s
   ruins. This activity emphasizes an ephemeral reality: in Attie’s words,
   “Like memory, the projection appears to have substance and materiality,
   but in fact it does not—it is only photons.” Neither the ruins nor the
   photographs possess meaning in and of themselves. They become active
   and present through our perception of them.

   Attie highlights that history and memory are not joined by a common
   reality—by the fact that this person was here, or this action took
   place—but are connected through our own perception of the past.
   Nostalgia too, as culturally mediated memory, is defined by how we
   approach it, rather than what it refers to. This makes it a
   particularly useful way for communities to tell stories about their
   shared concerns and current aspirations. Whether we realize it or not,
   we say a lot about ourselves when we reminisce about what we find
   valuable within the past.

   If the past is so flexible, perhaps we should think about how our
   current moment will age. Will we feel nostalgia for 2020? The question
   seems absurd. Why would anyone feel nostalgia for a moment synonymous
   with division, danger, and unrest? As the turn of the year approached
   and the pandemic wore on, the arrival of 2021 was imbued with
   liberating symbolism: warnings of “a dark winter” built our expectation
   for spring, while various vaccines promised “a light at the end of the
   tunnel.” If such momentum carries us out of the pandemic and into the
   future, who would want to remain attached to this year?

   It is important to ask this question because, as Attie attests, the
   links between history and memory, memory and nostalgia, are not as
   intuitive as they appear. On closer inspection, many nostalgic periods
   reveal their roots in moments of similar distress. The 1950s’ quaint
   suburbia is yoked to McCarthy-era witch-hunts and the threat of nuclear
   war. Soviet kitsch evokes Stalin and gulags as much as it does
   patriotism. And some in Britain even fondly remember the Blitz as a
   time of national unity amid, or even because of, imminent peril. If
   Britons can feel warmly about a time when bombs were literally landing
   on their doorsteps, it does not seem so far-fetched that people may
   feel differently about 2020 further down the road.

   While nostalgia often paints over history in broad strokes, it is not
   about burying the past. It is not as though hardship and pain simply
   vanish. Rather, suffering is placed in other frames of reference which
   de-emphasize it—or grant it a redeeming significance. These reactions
   capitalize on the fact that memory speaks to the present: our nostalgia
   is something which takes place in this moment. How people approach
   history is informed first and foremost by what they care about in the
   world around them, and this can outweigh the past’s more painful
   ordeals.

   On these terms, looking closer at two specific nostalgic images can
   help to illustrate how present-tense concerns overcome painful elements
   of the past, digesting history into powerfully resonant narratives.

Bronzeville
     __________________________________________________________________

   During the Great Migration, millions of Black Americans relocated from
   the rural South to the North, Midwest, and West. New and extant Black
   communities grew rapidly amid the influx of internal migrants.
   Bronzeville, in Chicago, was one such place.

   The image above was taken in April of 1941. Russell Lee, the
   photographer, was commissioned by the Farm Security Administration to
   document the movement of Black Americans toward the North, and he
   followed the path of migration to the Bronzeville neighborhood of
   Chicago. This image, taken on Easter, is part of Lee’s record of
   processionals, church services, and leisure activities that depict the
   liveliness and connectedness of the community. Here, as people wait in
   line for a matinée, their excitement and fashion give texture to this
   day in particular, and the life of the neighborhood in general.

   These images are instrumental to how Bronzeville has been remembered by
   Black Americans. Later communities have gathered around this period as
   a testament of strength, culture, and capability. The vibrancy Lee
   depicts is reflected in contemporary visions of an historical
   Bronzeville—in paintings, public art, and exhibitions—that valorize the
   neighborhood’s economic and cultural success.

   Yet all this came about because Black Americans were closed off in
   Bronzeville. As the neighborhood grew, pressure increased to prevent
   further racial integration with other areas of Chicago. Michelle Boyd
   drives this home in her book Jim Crow Nostalgia: Reconstructing Race in
   Bronzeville, where she describes how, beginning in the early twentieth
   century, “Whites responded to Blacks’ visibility and quest for economic
   and spatial resources by increasing segregation.” In large part, the
   authenticity perceived in Bronzeville’s Black culture is due to the
   forced concentration of Black Americans within this bounded space.
   Contemporary nostalgia tends to glide over this, highlighting the
   cultural value of these communities instead. In the neighborhood today,
   murals emphasize the strength of a cohesive Black community without
   dwelling much on why it was a minority enclave in the first place.

   What does this say about nostalgia’s relation to the past? Are
   Bronzeville’s warm memories at risk if their historical picture becomes
   fully exposed? Not quite. Nostalgia, after all, is a contemporary way
   of approaching the past that puts a present community’s values first.
   The disjunction between nostalgia and history reveals not so much a
   deficiency of memory as a priority for what matters here and now.
   Looking to Bronzeville of the 1940s as a vibrant and cohesive Black
   community supports people’s vision of what a successful neighborhood
   looks like. In this context, the fact of segregation does not wholly
   vanish, but takes a place within a different narrative for Black
   communities.

   These connections locate what is really important for nostalgic
   individuals and groups. Their nostalgia is about defining, envisioning,
   and supporting a perspective on history—on values, culture, and
   experiences—which connects with their contemporary concerns. This way
   of identifying what is valuable in certain nostalgic moments
   demonstrates how nostalgia is itself an inflected connection to the
   past. Even when that past includes seemingly insurmountable obstacles
   to this attachment, such as racial segregation, what is most important
   is where nostalgics find resonance and significance.

Kishinev
     __________________________________________________________________

   It is not always the case that nostalgic attachment to the past glosses
   over its challenging aspects, as with segregation or persecution. In
   some cases, that pain can be recontextualized as a meaningful feature
   of the nostalgia itself. This is how many Jews have valorized their
   eastern European, “old world” predecessors. Those Jews and their
   communities were shaped by anti-Semitic restrictions which opposed
   their integration and forced them to settle in specific areas.
   Nonetheless, later Jewish communities imagined those in the old world
   as forming a strong, authentic Jewish culture under that persecution.
   As with nostalgic reflection on Bronzeville, a situation of forced
   exclusion has been recast as a narrative about communal vibrancy.

   Unlike nostalgia for Bronzeville, Jewish nostalgia for the old world
   embraces its very pain and trauma. While nostalgia for Bronzeville has
   recast the fact of segregation within an aspirational narrative, the
   way that these Jewish communities are depicted often stresses their
   crushing poverty and ongoing persecution. This suffering itself is part
   of how eastern European Jews are endowed with a nostalgic feeling of
   authenticity. One example is Ephraim Moses Lilien’s eulogization of
   terrorized Jews in Kishinev, now the capital of Moldova, ChiȘina˘u.

   For three days in April of 1903, Jews were the target of unrelenting
   violence in Kishinev. This event garnered international attention; it
   was not only memorialized by artists such as Lilien, but was placed in
   context with other anti-Semitic riots which had occurred sporadically
   throughout eastern Europe. Kishinev was a particularly visible,
   disquieting example of the anti-Semitic prejudice which was a fact of
   eastern European Jewish life. However, outside of this historical
   context, Lilien’s engraving is especially resonant with the way that
   this violence was later woven into nostalgic narratives.

   Now, Lilien himself had his own aims for his artwork, and was not
   especially interested in casting eastern Europe as a site of nostalgia,
   but the messages he advanced became important for later nostalgic
   perspectives. In this image, religious overtones dominate, not only in
   the angel’s invocation of the divine, but also in the man’s long beard,
   prayer shawl, and kippah. Jewish communities have come together around
   the idea that their eastern European heritage encompasses both
   persecution and piety, trouble and tradition. This figure and others
   like him are all part of how the old world is imagined as a coherent
   package. These connections do not make persecution good in itself, but
   they do make past persecution a necessary part of what becomes really
   important to later Jewish communities: as the historian Rachel Kranson
   writes, eastern European Jews’ struggle is nostalgically depicted “as
   the handmaiden of deep spirituality, intellectualism, and generosity.”
   And so, while nostalgia does not repress this struggle, it wholly
   recasts it from its immediate distress.

   The way in which Jewish communities approach their heritage
   nostalgically lifts the pain of Lilien’s artwork into a different
   context. This perspective makes the Kishinev pogrom a pointed example
   of where violence and persecution mythologize eastern European Jews.
   This makes them special, holy, and authentic, which means that they can
   be embraced by later Jewish communities. The narrative here is no
   longer just about the violence in Kishinev but also about the values
   and strength that communities want to witness and represent in their
   own heritage and their own lives.

   This kind of thinking about the past underscores that pain does not
   preclude nostalgia. We can feel warmly about moments that are hurtful
   and dangerous. We can feel affinity for times that we would not
   actually want to live in. What is most important to recognize in these
   sorts of nostalgic attachments is how negative details are
   contextualized and what they imply: whether they recall ongoing
   struggles, as with Bronzeville, or emphasize what people value within
   their nostalgia, as with Kishinev.

Lockdown
     __________________________________________________________________

   The pandemic has created a moment for which nostalgia at first seems
   incomprehensible. The daily death toll, the fear of infection, and the
   isolation that characterize this moment have left us with an
   overwhelming desire to get out of this situation. For many, lockdown
   epitomizes the worst of this pandemic. It disperses communities,
   cutting people off from family and friends, care, and even basic
   resources. This challenge is very real. It is important not to take
   away from that.

   But it is also important to think about how the memory of this moment
   will develop in the future. At present, we are standing inside of the
   pandemic, and so its bitterness defines how we feel about it. However,
   as we can see from other examples, these things change as they age.
   Nostalgia teases certain narratives out of history, and nostalgia is
   beholden to the present over and above the past. This may mean that our
   lockdown’s isolation will be underplayed, like segregation in memories
   of Bronzeville, or that it will be recontextualized, like the
   persecution of eastern European Jews. Already, artists are reflecting
   on the pandemic and considering how it resonates in our society.

   In British photographer Sarah Weal’s series Furloughed Friendship, a
   personal project undertaken during lockdown, windows feature
   prominently. Severed from the outside world, and from Weal herself, her
   subjects exist in a space of insurmountable isolation. The transparent
   window becomes a divider; its reflectiveness serves to remind us of
   this separation. However, Weal also captures the way people are living
   with novel relationships on their side of the glass. Her subjects’
   gestures and contact speak to their connectedness, even as their gaze
   is directed toward the viewer, and this reflects one dynamic of
   lockdown. We often think of Zoom calls as this pandemic’s involuntary
   heritage, but the sheer amount of time spent with one another is an
   equally important change.

   While the word “lockdown” still rightly evokes isolation, it is
   possible that in the future it will be placed within a larger narrative
   that emphasizes closeness. This is not to say that we will have warm
   feelings about lockdown—proximity, after all, is not a positive thing
   in and of itself—but rather that we may come to ascribe an important
   value to these experiences. It is because nostalgia trades in the
   communal and the narrative that this is possible. The question is not
   so much, “Will we feel nostalgia for 2020?” as, “What will shape the
   nostalgia of the future?” What new factors will inform the way we feel
   about turning to the past?

   Some may dislike this nostalgic habit, sensing an arbitrariness to the
   stories it tells. But does nostalgia’s reshaping of the past really
   represent a disconnect with history? Not necessarily. Nostalgia does
   not show that “real” history is different because it is neutral;
   rather, it illustrates that no past is neutral, that nostalgia and
   history alike must be taken seriously. We must embrace the fact that
   our memory is informed by what we care about in the present. As we
   reflect on our present experiences, we do well to consider how our
   hardship will become meaningful in the future, and for whom.
