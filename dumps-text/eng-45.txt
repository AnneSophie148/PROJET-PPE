UTF-8 and Unicode

   Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit is a variable-width encoding that
   can represent every character in the Unicode character set. It was
   designed for backward compatibility with ASCII and to avoid the
   complications of endianness and byte order marks in UTF-16 and UTF-32.
   ^[1]

   UTF-8 encodes each Unicode character as a variable number of 1 to 4
   octets, where the number of octets depends on the integer value
   assigned to the Unicode character. It is an efficient encoding of
   Unicode documents that use mostly US-ASCII characters because it
   represents each character in the range U+0000 through U+007F as a
   single octet.

   UTF-8 is the default encoding for XML and since 2010 has become the
   dominant character set on the Web.

Standards

     * RFC 3629: UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646. November
       2003.
     * The Unicode Standard 5.0, November 2006. [purchase from Amazon.com]
          + In particular, see the informal description of UTF-8 in
            sections 2.5 and 2.6, pages 30-32, and a much more formal
            definition in sections 3.9 and 3.10, pages 77-81.

Character Sets

   The MIME character set attribute for UTF-8 is UTF-8. Character sets are
   case-insensitive, so utf-8 is equally valid. [IANA Character Sets].

   In a modern HTML 5 page, place this tag inside <head> ... </head>:
<meta charset="UTF-8">

   In an XML prolog, the encoding is typically specified as an attribute:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>

   Why Nostalgia Is Good for You

   On holidays, it's natural to feel a longing for times gone by—a
   childhood spent singing carols or meals spent with now departed loved
   ones. Recently scientists have explored the bittersweet feeling of
   nostalgia, finding that it serves a positive function, improving mood
   and possibly mental health. A new paper illuminates why it works,
   finding that this sepia-toned sentiment does not cement us in the past
   but actually raises our spirit and vitality.

   In several experiments conducted online and in the laboratory, when
   subjects were induced to experience wistful reverie via sentimental
   song lyrics or memories, they reported greater self-continuity, as
   measured by a validated index that asks participants how much they
   agree with statements such as “I feel connected with my past” and
   “important aspects of my personality remain the same over time.”
   Constantine Sedikides, a psychologist at the University of Southampton
   in England and the primary author of the paper, which was recently
   published in Emotion, had shown this effect in a 2015 paper. But here
   they found that nostalgia boosted self-continuity by increasing a sense
   of social connectedness. Sentimental recollections often include loved
   ones, which can remind us of a social web that extends across
   people—and across time.

   The researchers found this pattern in American, British and Chinese
   participants. They also went a step further and observed, via
   questionnaires about other concurrent feelings, that self-continuity
   brings a feeling of vitality—of “energy and spirit.”

   Tim Wildschut, one of Sedikides's Southampton collaborators on the
   paper, notes there are many ways people elicit nostalgia—looking at
   photographs, cooking certain meals, sharing stories or playing music.
   He calls the feeling, which we naturally experience several times a
   week, “a psychological immune response that is triggered when you
   experience little bumps in the road.” So if you are feeling a bit
   discombobulated over the holidays, pull out a photo album and spend
   some time revisiting your past.

   Nostalgia" in SA Mind 27, 6, 8-9 (November 2016)
