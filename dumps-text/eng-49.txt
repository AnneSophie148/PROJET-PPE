How the Internet Uses Nostalgia

   Long-lost memories pop up in music recommendations, personality
   quizzes, and ads. Why?

   Vanilla Ice is selling Kraft macaroni and cheese now. The dudes of Full
   House are selling Greek yogurt. Boyz II Men recently made a cameo on
   How I Met Your Mother. This year's Super Bowl featured, of all people,
   Flea. We are having a moment of '90s nostalgia, occasioned in part by
   millennials (or The Youths or Those Kids or whatever you want to call
   them) who are aging into adulthood and therefore eager to relive their
   childhoods.

   Which leads to, among other things, Ice coming back—yet again—with a
   brand new invention. And he's in good company, too. The boxed dinner
   the returned rapper would like you to buy? It features noodles that are
   shaped like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
   ***

   Nostalgia, the copious literature on it suggests, comes in two basic
   forms. One is organic, the kind that washes over you when you see an
   old picture of yourself and your cousins, aged 7 and 9 and 10, giggling
   maniacally while innertubing on Lake Michigan. The kind that emergences
   unexpectedly, as a kind of pleasant pang—the stuff of sudden songs and
   serendipitous scents and sour-sweet Madeleines.

   The other form—the form that may well feel most familiar to us at this
   point—is a media product. It's the re-introduction of Uncle Joey and/or
   Dawson’s Creek's Joey and/or Blossom's Joey, appropriated to arouse a
   vague sense that we have lost something as we’ve moved, inexorably,
   into our future. This form of nostalgia is usually invoked, in one way
   or another, to sell us stuff. You could, because of that, dismiss its
   validity (fauxstalgia?). But it will live on, inevitably, because media
   producers know exactly what advertisers have long understood: that
   nostalgia, like sex, sells.

   The products of that basic insight, whether they're movies or TV shows
   or weird appearances on terrible CBS sitcoms, tend to permeate the
   culture miasmically, their shiftings shaped by Hollywood and Wieden +
   Kennedy and the producers of Super Bowl Halftime Shows. And they can be
   good. They can be, sometimes, great! Take The Lego Movie (pardon me,
   The LEGO® Movie). And also: Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire and Masters of
   Sex and any theater that has ever offered a midnight showing of The Big
   Lebowski.

   Nostalgia, under the stewardship of the Internet, has been made nimble.

   As market goods, however, these products can also be recursive: Mad Men
   begat not only Banana Republic’s ’60s-inspired clothing line, but also
   books like Mad Women: The Other Side of Life on Madison Avenue in the
   '60s and Beyond. Baz Luhrmann’s remake of The Great Gatsby wasn’t
   merely a movie; it was also an album (a Target exclusive of which
   features three bonus tracks!) and a line of Brooks Brothers clothing
   and a collection of Tiffany jewelry.

   While, sure, commercial culture is commercial, it’s also notable how
   ambient nostalgia has become. The memorial-industrial complex ensures
   that our past—our collective past—permeates our present. That complex
   markets directly to memories that are shared, across generations and
   across demographics and across the culture.

   And the complex is extending, now, to the Internet.

   Donovan Sung manages discovery and recommendations at Spotify, the
   streaming music service that, as of the end of last year, claims 24
   million active users and 4.5 billion hours’ worth of song streams. Sung
   spends a lot of his time thinking about how to engage users and
   encourage their loyalty through the particular medium of music—about
   how to make those billions of hours, essentially, time that users will
   consider well spent. One of those ways is through what Spotify calls
   “stories”: little advertisements that live within the app and surface
   song recommendations to users.

   The stories vary in their messaging. Some are about making lateral
   connections between different songs and artists (“You listened to Otis
   Redding this week. Want to try James Brown?”). Some are about
   connecting users to their geographic settings (“This album by Foster
   the People is trending near you”). Some are about connecting users to
   songs whose rhythm or moods they might find appealing (“You listened to
   Neutral Milk Hotel this week. Want to try Sea Wolf?”).

   But some of Spotify’s most effective stories, Sung told me, take a
   slightly different tack: They present songs based not on your activity
   within Spotify, but on your activity outside of it. Activity that
   occurred long before Spotify was a gleam in Daniel Ek's eye.

   So some of the stories you’ll see on Spotify look like this:

   And like this:

   These recommendations vary according to a user’s birth date, which is
   one of the pieces of information Spotify gathers from its new members
   when they first sign up for the service. (Gender is another one.)
   Spotify uses those data points, in part, to read users’ pasts back to
   them, offering up a fairly faithful (re-)rendition of the popular
   musical landscape as it existed when they were younger.

   In all this, to be clear, Spotify isn’t necessarily surfacing the songs
   you were listening to when you were in high school. (Its data-tracking
   notwithstanding, how could it possibly know about the Fiona Apple phase
   you went through sophomore year?) What it’s doing, instead, is
   surfacing the songs that were popular across the culture when you were
   in junior or high school. The service is making the fair assumption
   that there will indeed be some overlap between your own musical past
   and the collective. And that, whether or not you care to admit it
   today, hearing “Hit Me, Baby, One More Time” again will take you right
   back to a particular moment in your life—that time you danced to it.
   That time you heard it on the radio as you were driving back from
   soccer practice. That time you tried, and totally failed, to unhear it.

   The point of all this past-leveraging, from Spotify’s perspective, is
   to realize the vague-but-also-urgent goal shared by many social
   networks and services: user engagement. "For almost everyone,” Sung
   says, a nostalgia-focused Spotify story “usually triggers some sort of
   strong emotion. Sometimes it's, 'Wow, I totally forgot that song.
   Thanks so much for reminding me of it.' Other times, it's more like,
   'Yeah, I remember music was pretty bad when I was young.’” (Case in
   point? "One of the stories I got was 'Britney Spears was big when you
   were young,’” Sung says. “And I was like, 'Yeah, I totally remember
   that, and I don't need to remember it again.’”)

   Either way, though: engagement. And an experience of the past that is
   customized—if not to a person, individually, then to that person's
   generational demographic. Spotify’s interpretation of nostalgia, in
   that sense, is pretty much the opposite of The LEGO® Movie’s or Mad
   Men's or that of Kraft-by-way-of-the-Ninja Turtles-by-way-of-Vanilla
   Ice. It's not aimed at a broad public. It’s not enforced at the level
   of the mass culture. Instead, it’s aimed directly at the user.

   It’s a targeted ad, essentially—and the thing being advertised is a
   person’s own past.

                                     ***

   Spotify isn’t alone in its use of nostalgia as a marketing tool. Social
   networks in general, you could argue, are
   implicitly—preemptively—nostalgic, combining our pasts and our
   presences into a unified experience.

   Networks, however, are also experimenting with more explicit forms of
   nostalgia-baiting. Earlier this month, Facebook rolled out “Look Back”
   compilations that collect users’ most-liked photos, statuses, and life
   events into an easily viewable video. (These collections come in
   addition to the old standby, the network’s “Year in Review” feature.)
   Instagram, of course, lets you present your self-shot digital images
   through the filters of analog cameras—a feature that users sometimes
   employ to participate in "throwback Thursday."

   And also! An app called Timehop promises to show you “photos and
   updates from this exact day in history.” Google Plus, as a default
   feature of its profile page, creates a personalized map highlighting
   the geographical locations a user has called home—an individualized
   bildungsroman, as told through markers. Google itself allows users to
   export their web histories—which double as page-by-page retrackings,
   essentially, of lives as lived on the Internet—for both archiving and
   analysis. Twitter, similarly, lets you download a complete archive of
   your tweet history—under the logic that, as Twitter engineer Mollie
   Vandor explained, “We know lots of you would like to explore your
   Twitter past.”

   Even Pinterest, which is most commonly associated with future-oriented
   and aspirational image-collecting, makes use of customized nostalgia.
   Gabriel Trionfi, Pinterest's user experience researcher, is a
   psychologist by training, and he points out that the flip side of
   anticipation—one of the emotions Pinterest uses to generation its own
   version of user engagement—is, yep, nostalgia.

   Journalists have long recognized the same thing advertisers have, which
   is that nostalgia is an extremely efficient tool for selling stuff.

   “Nostalgia is a known way to boost people's mood,” Trionfi told me. It
   allows people to live (and re-live) “something familiar, something they
   remember, a positive emotional experience.” On Pinterest, he points
   out, if you do a search for something like "80s kid" or "90s toys" or
   "80s cartoon," you'll be greeted with a wide of assortment of boards
   that celebrate users' youths. So people are using Pinterest’s
   future-oriented platform, Trionfi says, to re-collect images from their
   past.

   Nostalgia, at its most basic level, requires access to memories—and
   there is, of course, no better archive than the Internet. The social
   networks that are becoming increasingly synonymous with our experience
   of that Internet are attempting to use that fact for their own gain. “I
   think you see people seeking out and collecting these things,” Trionfi
   notes, for one simple reason: “Because it makes them feel good."

   The good feeling is growing. Many media outlets ("content producers,"
   you could call them) are selling nostalgia in one form or another:
   There’s Retronaut and @historyinpix and the many similar—and
   controversial—features dedicated to the resurfacing of the past.
   There’s New York magazine’s late, great “Nostalgia Face-Check” series.
   Yesterday, Wired—known mostly for its reporting on the future—published
   a list, curated by Questlove, of the top hip-hop tracks of the ’90s.
   (Questlove's collection includes something from Tony! Toni! Toné!, and
   is therefore awesome.)

   This is all fairly unremarkable; journalists have long recognized the
   same thing advertisers have, which is that nostalgia is an extremely
   efficient tool for selling stuff. But media outlets—especially the ones
   that are merging technological prowess with journalistic—aren’t just
   leveraging our soft enthusiasms for the past; they’re also taking a
   platform-focused approach to that work. They, like the social networks,
   are trafficking in targeted nostalgia.

   Take Buzzfeed’s ever-more-ubiquitous quizzes. “Which ‘90s Movie
   Soundtrack Are You?” asks one. “Which Grease Pink Lady Are You?” asks
   another. “Which Al Roker Are You?” asks yet another. (I am, apparently,
   “Al Roker Lifted by Ryan Gosling.” So.)

   “The quiz is kind of like the broken-down-to-its-core of what BuzzFeed
   is,” Summer Anne Burton, Buzzfeed’s managing editorial director and the
   head of its quiz initiative, told Nieman Lab. “It gives someone
   something that they can relate to well enough that they can share it
   with others.” Buzzfeed built a custom template so that its staffers and
   its community contributors can easily create these identity-focused
   questionnaires.

   Its quizzes are, at this point, the heirs of Buzzfeed’s lists, which
   are most commonly associated with generational demographics. (“25 Ways
   to Tell You’re a Kid of the ‘90s,” went one of those. And: “50 Things
   Only 80s Kids Can Understand.” And also: “53 Things Only ’80s Girls Can
   Understand.”) The sharetastic questionnaires allow users to identify
   with each other by means of their pasts. They do what journalists have
   long tried to do—identify microgenerations—by talking directly to the
   people who fit those demographics.

   The upshot of all this? Nostalgia no longer comes in one-size-fits-all,
   and that size is no longer “large.” Nostalgia, under the stewardship of
   the Internet, has been made nimble. Our tenuous relationship with the
   past can now be customized and made relevant, in the manner of a
   marketing message. We, like Proust, search for lost time. It's just
   that our seeking stretches beyond our own meager memories. And it may
   involve, for better or for worse, Britney Spears.
