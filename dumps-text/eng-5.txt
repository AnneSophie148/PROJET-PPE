Is Nostalgia a Past or Future-Oriented Experience? Affective, Behavioral,
Social Cognitive, and Neuroscientific Evidence

   [24] Taylor A. FioRito^* and [24] Clay Routledge
     * Department of Psychology, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND,

   Nostalgia, a sentimental longing for the past, is a common, universal,
   and highly social emotional experience. Nostalgic reverie is centered
   around the self, important social connections, and personally
   meaningful life events (e.g., graduation; Routledge, 2015). In other
   words, when people bring to mind memories that make them nostalgic,
   they are revisiting personally meaningful life events shared with loved
   ones. A growing body of research positions nostalgia as a psychological
   resource with self-regulatory implications. Negative affective states
   such as sadness, loneliness, and meaninglessness trigger nostalgia and
   nostalgia, in turn, enhances well-being, feelings of social
   connectedness, and perceptions of meaning in life (e.g., Routledge et
   al., 2013). Building on the behavioral inhibition (BIS/avoidance
   motivation) and behavioral activation (BAS/approach motivation)
   regulatory model Carver and White (1994), research also indicates that
   the activation of avoidance motivation increases nostalgia, which then
   activates approach motivation (Stephan et al., 2014). In the present
   analysis, we draw on the current state of the science to propose that
   nostalgia is ultimately a future-oriented emotional experience.
   Nostalgia involves reflecting on past experiences but it motivates
   affective states, behaviors, and goals that improve people's future
   lives. In the following sections, we briefly review relevant evidence
   across affective, behavioral, social cognitive, and neuroscientific
   indicators and close by considering the need for future research
   focused on nostalgia as a shared experience.

Future-Oriented Affect

   Nostalgia increases general well-being (Routledge et al., 2013) but
   also positively impacts motivation-relevant affect. For instance,
   nostalgia increases optimism (Cheung et al., 2013, 2016) inspiration
   (Stephan et al., 2015) social efficacy (Abeyta et al., 2015) and
   feelings of purpose in life (Routledge et al., 2011). In addition, as
   people get older, nostalgia makes them feel youthful and more
   optimistic about their health (Abeyta and Routledge, 2016). People's
   written accounts of nostalgic memories also frequently contain themes
   of appreciation for both the past and hopefulness for the future
   (Routledge, 2015). In short, nostalgia promotes the types of affective
   states that mobilize the self for action.

Future-Oriented Behavior

   Critically, nostalgia-induced affective states promote relevant
   behavior. For instance, health optimism triggered by nostalgia is
   associated with increased intentions to exercise and eat well, as well
   as subsequent levels of physical activity (Kersten et al., 2016).
   Similarly, the social efficacy nostalgia engenders leads to increased
   social engagement (Abeyta et al., 2015). More broadly, when people
   experience nostalgia, they are subsequently more likely to engage in
   prosocial behavior (Stephan et al., 2014), including charitable giving
   (Zhou et al., 2012). Nostalgia doesn't just make people feel inspired.
   It drives them to act on their inspiration.

Future-Oriented Social Cognition

   Arguably, the most compelling evidence that nostalgia is a
   future-oriented emotional experience is its effects on goal-related
   cognition, since goals are about the future. Nostalgia increases the
   importance people assign to relationship goals, intentions to pursue
   the goal of connecting with friends, and the desire to resolve a
   relationship problem (Abeyta et al., 2015). More broadly, nostalgia
   increases the motivation to pursue one's most important goal (Sedikides
   et al., 2017).

   Given the social nature of nostalgia, its impact on goals may be
   strongest in the interpersonal domain. Relatedly, nostalgia's impact on
   social motivation is moderated by individual differences in
   attachment-related avoidance (Abeyta et al., 2019). For individuals who
   rely on relationships for psychological comfort (low attachment-related
   avoidance), nostalgia increases social goal pursuit. For those who do
   not rely on relationships for comfort (high attachment-related
   avoidance), nostalgia decreases social goal pursuit. In sum, nostalgia
   mobilizes the self, particularly the social self.

The Motivated Brain

   The neuroscience of nostalgia remains limited. Nostalgia proneness is
   positively related to right-frontal electroencephalogram (EEG)
   asymmetry, an indicator avoidance motivation and negative emotions
   (Tullett et al., 2015). Although this evidence is correlational, and
   thus, we cannot determine causality from it, this finding is in line
   with past research suggesting that negative emotions and experiences,
   such as loneliness and meaninglessness, trigger nostalgia as a
   regulatory resource (e.g., Routledge et al., 2013). More recently,
   Bocincova et al. (2019) found that nostalgia reduced error related
   negativity (ERN; a neurological indicator of avoidance motivation) in
   response to making a mistake in a modified Flanker task, which is
   consistent with research indicating that nostalgia orients people away
   from avoidant and toward approach-related psychological states (Stephan
   et al., 2014). Notably, a preregistered follow-up study did not
   replicate these findings (FioRito et al., 2020). Further research is
   required to examine if, and how, nostalgia affects motivation as
   measured using social neuroscientific paradigms.

The Need For An Interpersonal Approach: Shared Nostalgia

   Although previous research demonstrates that nostalgia is primarily
   focused on social relationships, almost no work has explored how
   nostalgia occurs in a social setting. Nostalgia likely frequently
   implicates social interaction. Indeed, up to 75 percent of
   conversations may include nostalgic content (Pasupathi et al., 2002;
   Fivush, 2008; Baron and Bluck, 2009; Beike et al., 2016). Therefore,
   future research should explore nostalgia as a shared experience. We
   define shared nostalgia as nostalgia transmitted to at least one other
   person or exchanged between two or more people. The nature of shared
   nostalgia needs to be determined. How often does this occur? With whom?
   What is the role of approach motivation in sharing nostalgic memories
   with and between others? What social and emotional benefits, if any,
   can be gained?

   We posit that individuals share nostalgia for two purposes: to create
   and to maintain social connections. The future-oriented qualities of
   nostalgia may prompt an individual to share a nostalgic memory with an
   acquaintance to build closeness. Alternatively, those who discuss
   nostalgic memories with others may “bring online” a social approach
   motivation, increasing the extent to which the individuals connect. For
   instance, discussing a nostalgic childhood experience with a new
   acquaintance could promote self-disclosing behavior in both
   individuals. Does this boost a desire to deepen the relationship from
   acquaintances to friends? Moreover, people may discuss a nostalgic
   memory with others who also experienced in order to maintain the
   established intimacy. As an example, a couple reflecting together on
   their first date may feel intimate feelings toward one another. Does
   this, in turn, increase intentions to stay together?

Drawing From The Past For The Future

   By definition, nostalgia is a past-focused affective experience. A
   growing body of evidence, however, documents the future-oriented nature
   of nostalgia. Specifically, people can reference their nostalgic past
   to remind themselves what it felt to be young (Abeyta and Routledge,
   2016) and loved (e.g., Cheung et al., 2013), which, in turn, promotes
   future-oriented behavior, such as physically caring for oneself
   (Kersten et al., 2016), connecting with others (e.g., Abeyta et al.,
   2015), and pursuing goals (e.g., Sedikides et al., 2017). There are
   deviations from this process, however. For instance, Cheung et al.
   (2019) recently introduced the concept of anticipated nostalgia. This
   construct is unique in that it does not rely on the reflections of the
   past. Instead, anticipated nostalgia is nostalgia for the present and
   the future (e.g., “I anticipate I will feel nostalgic about my
   children's childhood in the future”). Critically, Cheung et al. (2019)
   found that anticipated nostalgia is related to deliberate savoring
   techniques, such as purchasing souvenirs and documenting moments with
   pictures. Thus, anticipated nostalgia could be considered a
   future-focused experience that promotes future-oriented behavior. When
   discussing the future-oriented nature of nostalgia, individual
   differences should be considered, as well; not everyone benefits from
   using nostalgia (e.g., attachment-related avoidance; Wildschut et al.,
   2010; Juhl et al., 2012; Abeyta et al., 2019). Future research should
   examine other instances in which nostalgia does not result in
   future-oriented behavior.

   Taken together, when individuals engage in nostalgic reflection, they
   are not hiding in the past. They are accessing meaningful memories from
   the past in order to help them approach the future with purpose.
