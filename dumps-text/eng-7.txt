5 Ways Nostalgia Is Good for Your Health (and When It's Not)

   Fleeting memories from your past don’t just bring on warm and fuzzy
   feelings — they could influence your mental health and personal growth.

   It’s common to sometimes find yourself longing for the past — to think
   back on your childhood or early adulthood and wistfully recall memories
   that leave you feeling warm and fuzzy. That’s called nostalgia.

   “It’s the positive, wistful, or longing sentiment that one experiences
   when they are reminded of something from the past,” says Deanna
   Woodhouse, a licensed marriage and family therapist and director of
   clinical operations at Los Angeles–based Lightfully Behavioral Health.
   Nostalgia could come about by looking at an old photograph, talking
   with a friend, or smelling a familiar scent.

   Is feeling nostalgic good for your health?

   It’s a question psychologists are particularly interested in. “It can
   influence people's well-being,” says David Newman, PhD, a postdoctoral
   scholar in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the
   University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, who studies
   nostalgia.

   It comes up clinically as well. “Sometimes when a client needs a
   grounding point, we will discuss things they look back upon fondly and
   draw upon the nostalgia experience,” Woodhouse says. “Nostalgia can be
   beneficial when dealing with dark times and reminding clients there was
   once light.”

5 Ways Feeling Nostalgic Is Good for You

   In a review published in February 2020 in the Journal of Personality
   and Social Psychology, researchers (including Dr. Newman) concluded
   that thinking back on your memories is primarily a positive experience,
   and that nostalgia, practicing nostalgia, or the act of feeling
   nostalgic was more commonly linked to positive markers of health (like
   meaning in life, self-esteem, and optimism) than negative ones. But the
   researchers did note that it’s a mixed emotion, and does not always
   have positive effects on people.

   Here are five benefits linked to nostalgia:

1. It May Promote Sense of Self

   Reminiscing about the past can help you feel connected to who you were
   in the past, who you are in the present, and who you will be in the
   future, according to a study published in June 2021 in the journal
   Cognition and Emotion.

   “If you are fondly recalling memories that align with your values and
   morals, this can affirm movement toward those ideas,” Woodhouse says.
   “This would definitely increase the sense of self and motivate
   confidence.” She adds that oftentimes thinking back on your former self
   reunites you with your values and what truly matters to you.

2. It Can Serve as a Barometer for Personal Growth

   Nostalgia can also show you how far you’ve come. “Change doesn’t happen
   overnight,” Woodhouse says. “When we can draw upon those positive
   experiences and reflect upon our own growth, nostalgia can be a good
   barometer to gauge how we have stayed aligned with our own values
   (which may change over time, and that's okay) and our authentic
   selves.”

   She says looking back at the past can help you see where you have
   evolved and how you’ve grown into who you are in the present.

3. It May Boost Mood

   Nostalgia can lead to a positive affect, according to a study published
   April 2021 in Consciousness and Cognition. If you’re feeling bogged
   down by negativity, dipping into nostalgic feelings could help
   alleviate those emotions temporarily.

   “This can allow someone who is highly dysregulated to calm themselves
   down and utilize healthy coping mechanisms,” Woodhouse says. Recalling
   positive memories can transition emotions from negative to neutral — or
   even positive, Woodhouse says. After all, it's common to feel a little
   boost from thinking back to happy Little League memories or how
   satisfied you felt eating your grandma’s famous cherry pie as a kid.

   In fact, research suggests that feelings of nostalgia increased during
   COVID-19 quarantines, serving as a comfort during isolating times,
   according to a review article published in 2021 in the Journal of
   Nervous and Mental Disease.

4. It May Help Strengthen Bonds With Friends and Family

   According to a study published in April 2021 in the journal Emotion,
   nostalgia is a highly social emotion that connects us to others. Based
   on a series of five experiments, the researchers concluded that
   nostalgia can be used as a way to facilitate "help seeking behavior" by
   fostering social connectedness.

   Reminiscing with family and friends, watching home videos, or viewing
   photos from the past can help you feel closer and more connected, other
   research suggests. And it works even if you’re complete strangers and
   connecting over shared experiences from the past, such as Millennials
   relating over '90s cartoons and dial-up connections, Woodhouse says.
   "Nostalgia can unify our experiences."

5. It Could Make You More Optimistic

   The aforementioned February 2020 paper from the Journal of Personality
   and Social Psychology noted that nostalgia can increase optimism. This
   is rooted in the fact that, oftentimes, reminiscing about fond memories
   brings us back to happy times. “When we remember good times or
   reexperience love, it can remind us of feeling successful and
   accomplished,” Woodhouse says.

   Optimism is having the ability to think positively of the future, and
   recalling moments that made you feel courageous, happy, successful, or
   any other positive emotion gives you an optimistic lens to see the
   future through, Woodhouse says. “This can help us live each day to the
   fullest or even help us see the beauty that is in everyday life,” she
   says.

The Potential Downside of Nostalgia

   Most of the time when someone talks about nostalgia, they’re referring
   to personal nostalgia, or longing for moments they’ve experienced in
   their own life. As mentioned, this experience is generally positive,
   but it can bring on sadness, too.

   Newman calls it a mixed emotion. Anticipatory nostalgia, for instance,
   which is missing the present while you’re still living it, can result
   in sadness, according to a study published May 2020 in Frontiers in
   Psychology. Anticipatory nostalgia is defined in the paper as the
   “premature missing of what is still present” and “future loss.”

   Nostalgia can also induce sadness if you’re yearning for the past, and
   upset that the times you’re thinking of no longer exist. “When you long
   for a time in your past, it can make you miss that time,” Newman says.

   Woodhouse has seen this as well. “When we start to reminisce on the
   ‘good old days’ and begin to linger in the past, we can ruminate on the
   ‘what ifs’ and ‘should haves,’ which can lead to depression,” she says.

   Whether the experience of nostalgia will be positive or negative can
   depend on how it’s introduced. The same 2020 study published in the
   Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that suggested nostalgia
   can boost optimism also found that it is more closely linked with
   sadness if the nostalgia was unprompted and came up organically during
   the day. But it’s more positive if you’re specifically asked to
   reminisce.

   In addition to personal nostalgia, there’s historical or collective
   nostalgia, which is a longing for a time in history that you did not
   personally experience, according to the American Psychological
   Association.

   “For example, you could feel nostalgic for the renaissance era even
   though you never lived during that time,” Newman says.

   Historical nostalgia can be dangerous, however, if someone in power
   uses it to push society back toward negative concepts and practices,
   such as racism or discrimination. Newman adds that there can also be a
   positive side to historical nostalgia in that it can lead to a greater
   sense of connectedness. “So there could be some benefits and harmful
   consequences, too,” he says.
