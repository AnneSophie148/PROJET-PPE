The Meaning of Nostalgia

The psychology and philosophy of nostalgia.

   Nostalgia is sentimentality for the past, typically for a particular
   period or place with positive associations, but sometimes also for the
   past in general, ‘the good old days of yore’.

   At the end of André Brink’s novel, An Instant in the Wind, Adam says,
   ‘The land which happened inside us no one can take away from us again,
   not even ourselves.’ Nostalgia combines the sadness of loss with the
   joy or consolation that the loss is not complete, nor ever can be.
   Mortal though we are, whatever little life we have snared from the
   legions of death is forever ours.

   ‘Nostalgia’ is a portmanteau neologism coined in 1688 by Swiss medical
   student Johannes Hofer, from the Greek nóstos [homecoming] and álgos
   [pain, ache]. Nóstos is, of course, the overarching theme of Homer’s
   Odyssey, in which, in the aftermath of the Trojan War, Odysseus strives
   to return to Penelope and Telemachus and his native Ithaca.

   In Virgil’s Æneid, Æneas, another survivor of the Trojan War and an
   ancestor of Romulus and Remus, gazes upon a Carthaginian mural
   depicting battles of the Trojan War. Mourning the loss of his Trojan
   kin, he cries out, sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt:
   ‘These are the tears of things and mortal things touch the mind.’

   And it’s not just the Greeks and the Trojans. In the Biblical Psalms,
   the Jewish people from their Babylonian captivity lament the loss of
   their homeland, in verses made famous by Boney M:

     By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down/ Yea, we wept, when we
     remembered Zion.

   Hofer coined ‘nostalgia’ to refer to the homesickness of Swiss
   mercenaries fighting in foreign lowlands. Military physicians
   attributed this homesickness, also known as Schweizerheimweh or mal du
   suisse, to ear and brain damage from the constant clanging of cowbells.
   Recognized symptoms included pining for Alpine landscapes, fainting,
   fever, and even, in extremis, death. In the Dictionnaire de musique,
   Jean-Jacques Rousseau claims that Swiss mercenaries were forbidden from
   singing their Swiss songs so as not to aggravate their nostalgia.

   Today, nostalgia is no longer looked upon as a mental disorder, but as
   a natural, common, and even positive emotion, a vehicle for travelling
   beyond the suffocating confines of time and space. Bouts of nostalgia
   are often prompted by thoughts about the past; particular places and
   objects; feelings of loneliness, disconnectedness, or meaninglessness;
   and repeated sounds, smells, tastes, textures, and times of year.

   When I was a child, my English sheepdog Oscar got runover by a tractor
   and had to be put to sleep. Apart from the memories, all I kept from
   him was a tuft of his fur. Like the toys and books of our childhood, or
   our childhood home or bedroom, this tuft of fur became a sort of time
   portal, which, for many years, helped me to reminisce about Oscar.

   I say ‘help’ because nostalgia does have an unexpected number of
   adaptive functions. Our everyday is humdrum, often even absurd.
   Nostalgia can lend us much-needed context, perspective, and direction,
   reminding and reassuring us that our life (and that of others) is not
   as banal as it may seem, that it is rooted in a narrative, and that
   there have been, and will once again be, meaningful moments and
   experiences.

   No surprise, then, that nostalgia is more pronounced in uncertain times
   and times of transition or change. According to one study, it is also
   more common on cold days or in cold rooms, and makes us feel warmer!

   In that much, nostalgia serves a similar function to anticipation,
   which can be defined as enthusiasm and excitement for some expected or
   hoped-for positive event. The hauntings of times gone by, and the
   imaginings of times to come, strengthen us in lesser times.

   It’s a strange thing: the memory of a scene from the distant past,
   haunted by people who have grown up or grown old or are no more, doing
   things that are no longer done in a world that no longer exists. And
   yet it all seems so vivid in our minds that we can still see the glint
   in their eyes or the twitch at the corner of their mouths. Sometimes we
   even say their names under our breath as if that could magically bring
   them back to us.

   Nostalgia is nothing if not paradoxical. In supplying us with substance
   and texture, it also reminds us of their lack and, in the reminding,
   moves us to compensation. Unfortunately, this compensation often takes
   the form of spending, and marketers exploit nostalgia to sell us
   everything from music and clothes to cars and houses.

   It could be argued that nostalgia is a form of self-deception in that
   it invariably involves distortion and idealization of the past, not
   least because the bad or boring bits are erased from our memory,
   leaving only the peak experiences. The Romans had a tag for the
   phenomenon that psychologists have come to call ‘rosy retrospection’:
   memoria præteritorum bonorum, ‘the past is always well remembered’.

   If overindulged, nostalgia can give rise to a utopia that never existed
   and never can exist, but that is pursued at all costs, sapping all life
   and joy and potential from the present. For many people, paradise is
   not so much a place to go to as the place (they think) they came from.

   Nostalgia can be fruitfully compared with a number of similar or
   related concepts, including saudade, mono no aware, wabi-sabi, and
   Sehnsucht.

   Saudade is a Portuguese and Galician word for the love and longing for
   someone or something that has been lost and may never be regained. It
   is the desolate incompleteness or wistful dreaminess that can be felt
   even in the presence of its object, when that presence is threatened or
   incomplete—as, for example, in the famous final scene of Cinema
   Paradiso. The rise of saudade coincided with the decline of Portugal
   and the yen for its imperial heyday, a yen so strong as to have been
   written into the national anthem: Levantai hoje de novo o esplendor de
   Portugal [‘Let us once again lift up the splendour of Portugal’].

   An epitome of mono no aware is the annual blossoming of cherry trees.
   The literal translation, from Japanese, of mono no aware is ‘the pathos
   of things’. Coined in the eighteenth century by Motoori Norinaga for
   his literary criticism of the Tale of Genjii, it refers to a heightened
   consciousness of the transience of things coupled with an acute
   appreciation of their ephemeral beauty and a gentle sadness or
   wistfulness at their passing—and, by extension, at the realization,
   reminder, or truth that all things must pass. Although beauty itself is
   eternal in its recurrence, its particular manifestations are unique
   insofar as they, and we the observer, cannot be preserved or
   replicated.

   Related to mono no aware is wabi-sabi, an æsthetic of impermanence and
   imperfection rooted in Zen Buddhism. Wabi-sabi calls upon the
   acceptance and espousal of transience and inadequacy to foster a sense
   of serene melancholy and spiritual longing, and, with it, liberation
   from the material and mundane distractions of everyday life. Hagi pots
   with their pockmarked surfaces, cracked glaze, and signature chip are
   an embodiment of wabi-sabi. With age, the pots take on deeper tones and
   become even more fragile and unique. Objects in our everyday lives that
   can be wabi-sabi include stone buildings, wooden floorboards, leather
   goods, books, and clothes.

   Sehnsucht is German for ‘longing’ or ‘craving’. It is dissatisfaction
   with an imperfect reality paired with the yearning for an ideal that
   comes to seem more real than the reality itself, as in the final lines
   of Walt Whitman’s Song of the Universal:

     Is it a dream?/ Nay, but the lack of it the dream/ And, failing it,
     life’s lore and wealth a dream/ And all the world a dream.

   CS Lewis called Sehnsucht ‘the inconsolable longing in the heart for we
   know not what’. In the Pilgrim’s Regress, he describes the feeling as:
   ‘that unnameable something, desire for which pierces us like a rapier
   at the smell of bonfire, the sound of wild ducks flying overhead, the
   title of the The Well at the World’s End, the opening lines of Kubla
   Khan, the morning cobwebs in late summer, or the noise of falling
   waves.’

   Lewis redefines this feeling as ‘joy’, which he understands as ‘an
   unsatisfied desire which is itself more desirable than any other
   satisfaction’. The paradox of ‘joy’ arises from the self-defeating
   nature of human desire, which might be thought of as nothing more than
   a desire for desire, a longing for longing.

   In The Weight of Glory, Lewis illustrates this from the age-old quest
   for beauty:

     The books or the music in which we thought the beauty was located
     will betray us if we trust to them; it was not in them, it only came
     through them, and what came through them was longing. These
     things—the beauty, the memory of our own past—are good images of
     what we really desire; but if they are mistaken for the thing itself
     they turn into dumb idols, breaking the hearts of their worshippers.
     For they are not the thing itself; they are only the scent of a
     flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news
     from a country we have not visited.

   Emotions and other books.
